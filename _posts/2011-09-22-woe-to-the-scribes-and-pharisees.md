<p>By Mark Mayberry</p>  <p>Jesus repeatedly accused the Scribes and Pharisees of hypocrisy (Matt. 23:1-36; Mark 12:37b-40; Luke 20:45-47; cf. John 13:4-5, 12-17). The Greek word <i>hupokrisis</i> refers to a pretentious play-actor, i.e., one who attempts to create a public impression that is at odds with their real purpose and motivation. The Scribes and Pharisees are denounced for their spirit of prideful prerogative, as evidenced by their religious garb (phylacteries, tassels) and their religious titles (Rabbi, Father, Leader). They debased the work of service (forgetting the definition of true greatness), of instruction (refusing the truth themselves and shutting off kingdom access for others), and of benevolence (robbing widowâ€™s houses and offering pretentious prayers). They despoiled their personal integrity (affirming that an oath by the temple or the altar is worthless, while an oath by the gold of the temple or the offering on the altar is obligatory). They degraded the concept of obedience (straining the gnat, but swallowing the camel; paying tithes of the smallest garden herbs [which they should have done], while neglecting the weightier matters of the law [which they should not have done]). They were deceitful and duplicitous (focusing exclusively on outward appearance rather than inward reality, forgetting that God sees and judges both). They were self-deluded (saying, if we had lived in older days, we would not have persecuted the prophets; when in reality they would commit the crime of the ages, by crucifying the very Son of God).</p>
