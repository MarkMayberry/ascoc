# Dangers of Denominationalism

## Introduction

Denominationalism refers to the division of Christianity into separate religious groups. The term is particularly used about the various Protestant schools of thought. Examples include Presbyterians, Methodists, Anglicans, Lutherans, Baptists, or the many Bible churches of today.

*Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary* defines "denomination" as "(1) an act of denominating (i.e., to give a name to, designate); (2) a value or size of a series of values or sizes (as of money); (3) name, designation; especially: a general name for a category; (4) a religious organization uniting local congregations in a single legal and administrative body."

Religious denominationalism stands in stark contrast with biblical teaching. Jesus said, "I will build My church" (Matt. 16:16-18). Christ is head of the church, which is His body (Eph. 1:22-23). This body, in which both Jew and Gentile are reconciled, is singular and unique (Eph. 2:14-16; 4:1-6, esp. v. 5).

> Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God." And Jesus said to him, "Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but My Father who is in heaven. "I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church; and the gates of Hades will not overpower it" (Matt. 16:16-18).

> And He put all things in subjection under His feet, and gave Him as head over all things to the church, which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all (Eph. 1:22-23).

> For He Himself is our peace, who made both groups into one and broke down the barrier of the dividing wall, by abolishing in His flesh the enmity, which is the Law of commandments contained in ordinances, so that in Himself He might make the two into one new man, thus establishing peace, and might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, by it having put to death the enmity (Eph. 2:14-16).

> Therefore I, the prisoner of the Lord, implore you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called, with all humility and gentleness, with patience, showing tolerance for one another in love, being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. There is one body and one Spirit, just as also you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all (Eph. 4:1-6).

## Mocks the Need for Unity

Denominationalism mocks the biblical mandate for unity. Men look at religious division, and say, "It is good." God declares otherwise.

The Psalmist said, "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity!" (Ps. 133:1-3).

> Behold, how good and how pleasant it is For brothers to dwell together in unity! It is like the precious oil upon the head, Coming down upon the beard, Even Aaron's beard, Coming down upon the edge of his robes. It is like the dew of Hermon Coming down upon the mountains of Zion; For there the LORD commanded the blessing—life forever (Ps. 133:1-3).

Jeremiah foreshadowed a time when God's people would have "one heart and one way" (Jer. 32:38-40).

> They shall be My people, and I will be their God; and I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear Me always, for their own good and for the good of their children after them. I will make an everlasting covenant with them that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; and I will put the fear of Me in their hearts so that they will not turn away from Me (Jer. 32:38-40).

Jesus prayed for perfect unity among believers (John 17:20-23).

> I do not ask on behalf of these alone, but for those also who believe in Me through their word; that they may all be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us, so that the world may believe that You sent Me. The glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, just as We are one; I in them and You in Me, that they may be perfected in unity, so that the world may know that You sent Me, and loved them, even as You have loved Me (John 17:20-23).

Paul exhorted the Corinthians to avoid division, and be made complete in the same mind and judgment (1 Cor. 1:10-13).

> Now I exhort you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all agree and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be made complete in the same mind and in the same judgment. For I have been informed concerning you, my brethren, by Chloe's people, that there are quarrels among you. Now I mean this, that each one of you is saying, "I am of Paul," and "I of Apollos," and "I of Cephas," and "I of Christ." Has Christ been divided? Paul was not crucified for you, was he? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul? (1 Cor. 1:10-13).

Similar exhortation was offered to the Philippians (Phil. 1:27).

> Only conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or remain absent, I will hear of you that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel (Phil. 1:27).

## Exalts Human Names Above Divine

Denominationalism exalts human names above divine names. Men choose names that glorify some religious leader, organizational structure, or distinguishing practice.

Apostolic preaching centered upon the person of Jesus Christ (Acts 8:12; 1 Cor. 2:1-5).

> But when they believed Philip preaching the good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were being baptized, men and women alike (Acts 8:12).

> And when I came to you, brethren, I did not come with superiority of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God. For I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ, and Him crucified. I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling, and my message and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, so that your faith would not rest on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God (1 Cor. 2:1-5).

His name held the power of forgiveness (Acts 2:38; 10:42-43), which was confirmed by signs and wonders performed by Jesus and His apostles (Acts 3:6-8; 4:8-12).

> Peter said to them, "Repent, and each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit" (Acts 2:38).

> And He ordered us to preach to the people, and solemnly to testify that this is the One who has been appointed by God as Judge of the living and the dead. Of Him all the prophets bear witness that through His name everyone who believes in Him receives forgiveness of sins (Acts 10:42-43).

> But Peter said, "I do not possess silver and gold, but what I do have I give to you: In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene—walk!" And seizing him by the right hand, he raised him up; and immediately his feet and his ankles were strengthened. With a leap he stood upright and began to walk; and he entered the temple with them, walking and leaping and praising God (Acts 3:6-8).

> Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, "Rulers and elders of the people, if we are on trial today for a benefit done to a sick man, as to how this man has been made well, let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead—by this name this man stands here before you in good health. He is the STONE WHICH WAS REJECTED by you, THE BUILDERS, but WHICH BECAME THE CHIEF CORNER stone. And there is salvation in no one else; for there is no other name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must be saved" (Acts 4:8-12).

Therefore, it is not surprising that "the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch" (Acts 11:25-26; cf. also Acts 26:28; 1 Pet. 4:15-16).

> And he left for Tarsus to look for Saul; and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. And for an entire year they met with the church and taught considerable numbers; and the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch (Acts 11:25-26).

Apostolic era congregations were called "the church(es) of God" (Acts 20:28; 1 Cor. 1:2; 10:32; 11:16; 11:22; 15:9; 2 Cor. 1:1; Gal. 1:13; 1 Thess. 2:14; 2 Thess. 1:4; 1 Tim. 3:5, 15).

> And he left for Tarsus to look for Saul; and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. And for an entire year they met with the church and taught considerable numbers; and the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch (Acts 11:25-26).

> Be on guard for yourselves and for all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God which He purchased with His own blood (Acts 20:28).

> To the church of God which is at Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, saints by calling, with all who in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their Lord and ours (1 Cor. 1:2).

> Give no offense either to Jews or to Greeks or to the church of God (1 Cor. 10:32).

> But if one is inclined to be contentious, we have no other practice, nor have the churches of God (1 Cor. 11:16).

> What! Do you not have houses in which to eat and drink? Or do you despise the church of God and shame those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? In this I will not praise you (1 Cor. 11:22).

> For I am the least of the apostles, and not fit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God (1 Cor. 15:9).

> Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, To the church of God which is at Corinth with all the saints who are throughout Achaia (2 Cor. 1:1).

> For you have heard of my former manner of life in Judaism, how I used to persecute the church of God beyond measure and tried to destroy it (Gal. 1:13).

> For you, brethren, became imitators of the churches of God in Christ Jesus that are in Judea, for you also endured the same sufferings at the hands of your own countrymen, even as they did from the Jews (1 Thess. 2:14).

> therefore, we ourselves speak proudly of you among the churches of God for your perseverance and faith in the midst of all your persecutions and afflictions which you endure (2 Thess. 1:4).

> (but if a man does not know how to manage his own household, how will he take care of the church of God?) (1 Tim. 3:5).

> but in case I am delayed, I write so that you will know how one ought to conduct himself in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and support of the truth (1 Tim. 3:15).

Collectively, they were called "the churches of Christ" (Rom. 16:16).

> Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ greet you (Rom. 16:16).

New Testament churches wore names that signified location: Galatia (1 Cor. 16:1; Gal. 1:2), Asia (1 Cor. 16:19), Macedonia (2 Cor. 8:1), Judea (Gal. 1:22), Laodicea (Col. 4:16), Thessalonica (1 Thess. 1:1; 2 Thess. 1:1).

> Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I directed the churches of Galatia, so do you also (1 Cor. 16:1).

> and all the brethren who are with me, To the churches of Galatia (Gal. 1:2).

> The churches of Asia greet you. Aquila and Prisca greet you heartily in the Lord, with the church that is in their house (1 Cor. 16:19).

> Now, brethren, we wish to make known to you the grace of God which has been given in the churches of Macedonia (2 Cor. 8:1).

> I was still unknown by sight to the churches of Judea which were in Christ (Gal. 1:22).

> When this letter is read among you, have it also read in the church of the Laodiceans; and you, for your part read my letter that is coming from Laodicea (Col. 4:16).

> Paul and Silvanus and Timothy, To the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace (1 Thess. 1:1).

> Paul and Silvanus and Timothy, To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ (2 Thess. 1:1).

They also wore designations that signified blessings: "the churches of the saints" (1 Cor. 14:33) and also "the church of the firstborn" (Heb. 12:23).

> for God is not a God of confusion but of peace, as in all the churches of the saints (1 Cor. 14:33).

> to the general assembly and church of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God, the Judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect (Heb. 12:23).

The church is God's field and building (1 Cor. 3:1-9). Should not its name identify possession and ownership?

> And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to men of flesh, as to infants in Christ. I gave you milk to drink, not solid food; for you were not yet able to receive it. Indeed, even now you are not yet able, for you are still fleshly. For since there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly, and are you not walking like mere men? For when one says, "I am of Paul," and another, "I am of Apollos," are you not mere men? What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? Servants through whom you believed, even as the Lord gave opportunity to each one. I planted, Apollos watered, but God was causing the growth. So then neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but God who causes the growth. Now he who plants and he who waters are one; but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor. For we are God's fellow workers; you are God's field, God's building (1 Cor. 3:1-9).

Since the church is the bride of Christ (Eph. 5:25-27). Should it not wear His name?

> Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her, so that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, that He might present to Himself the church in all her glory, having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that she would be holy and blameless (Eph. 5:25-27).

## Makes God the Author of Confusion

Denominationalism makes God the author of confusion. The churches of men teach ("any and every," constantly-changing, ever-evolving, you fill-in-the blank) doctrine. Mainstream churches long ago denied the inspiration and authority of Sacred Scripture. Those who still pay lip-service to such things, still celebrate unity in diversity.

Paul rebuked the Corinthians for their divided loyalties (1 Cor. 1:10-13) and for confused assemblies (1 Cor. 14:26-33). If such censure was justified when Paul, Apollos and Peter taught the same things, how much more is it necessary when men teach differing doctrines?

> Now I exhort you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all agree and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be made complete in the same mind and in the same judgment. For I have been informed concerning you, my brethren, by Chloe's people, that there are quarrels among you. Now I mean this, that each one of you is saying, "I am of Paul," and "I of Apollos," and "I of Cephas," and "I of Christ." Has Christ been divided? Paul was not crucified for you, was he? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul? (1 Cor. 1:10-13).

> What is the outcome then, brethren? When you assemble, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for edification. If anyone speaks in a tongue, it should be by two or at the most three, and each in turn, and one must interpret; but if there is no interpreter, he must keep silent in the church; and let him speak to himself and to God. Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others pass judgment. But if a revelation is made to another who is seated, the first one must keep silent. For you can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all may be exhorted; and the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets; for God is not a God of confusion but of peace, as in all the churches of the saints (1 Cor. 14:26-33).

If the Corinthian church was condemned for their disorderly assemblies, even when Spirit-guided men taught accurately, how much greater the transgression when uninspired men preach another gospel (Gal. 1:6-12)?

> I am amazed that you are so quickly deserting Him who called you by the grace of Christ, for a different gospel; which is really not another; only there are some who are disturbing you and want to distort the gospel of Christ. But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you a gospel contrary to what we have preached to you, he is to be accursed! As we have said before, so I say again now, if any man is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you received, he is to be accursed! For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? Or am I striving to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a bond-servant of Christ. For I would have you know, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man. For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ (Gal. 1:6-12).

Disturbances, disorder and divisions inevitably occur when human wisdom predominates (Rom. 16:16-19; 2 Cor. 12:20-21; Jas. 3:13-18).

> Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ greet you. Now I urge you, brethren, keep your eye on those who cause dissensions and hindrances contrary to the teaching which you learned, and turn away from them. For such men are slaves, not of our Lord Christ but of their own appetites; and by their smooth and flattering speech they deceive the hearts of the unsuspecting. For the report of your obedience has reached to all; therefore I am rejoicing over you, but I want you to be wise in what is good and innocent in what is evil (Rom. 16:16-19).

> For I am afraid that perhaps when I come I may find you to be not what I wish and may be found by you to be not what you wish; that perhaps there will be strife, jealousy, angry tempers, disputes, slanders, gossip, arrogance, disturbances; I am afraid that when I come again my God may humiliate me before you, and I may mourn over many of those who have sinned in the past and not repented of the impurity, immorality and sensuality which they have practiced (2 Cor. 12:20-21).

> Who among you is wise and understanding? Let him show by his good behavior his deeds in the gentleness of wisdom. But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, do not be arrogant and so lie against the truth. This wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly, natural, demonic. For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there is disorder and every evil thing. But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, unwavering, without hypocrisy. And the seed whose fruit is righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace (Jas. 3:13-18).

## Demands Compromise with Error

Denominationalism demands compromise with error. Celebrating unity in diversity, men say, "It doesn't matter what you believe, so long as you are sincere." God's word affirms otherwise.

People are led astray through philosophy and empty deception that accords with the tradition of men (Col. 2:8-12).

> See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deception, according to the tradition of men, according to the elementary principles of the world, rather than according to Christ. For in Him all the fullness of Deity dwells in bodily form, and in Him you have been made complete, and He is the head over all rule and authority; and in Him you were also circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, in the removal of the body of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ; having been buried with Him in baptism, in which you were also raised up with Him through faith in the working of God, who raised Him from the dead (Col. 2:8-12).

Human ordinances are of no value against fleshly indulgence (Col. 2:16-23).

> Therefore no one is to act as your judge in regard to food or drink or in respect to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath day— things which are a mere shadow of what is to come; but the substance belongs to Christ. Let no one keep defrauding you of your prize by delighting in self-abasement and the worship of the angels, taking his stand on visions he has seen, inflated without cause by his fleshly mind, and not holding fast to the head, from whom the entire body, being supplied and held together by the joints and ligaments, grows with a growth which is from God. If you have died with Christ to the elementary principles of the world, why, as if you were living in the world, do you submit yourself to decrees, such as, "Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch!" (which all refer to things destined to perish with use)—in accordance with the commandments and teachings of men? These are matters which have, to be sure, the appearance of wisdom in self-made religion and self-abasement and severe treatment of the body, but are of no value against fleshly indulgence (Col. 2:16-23).

We must faithfully preach the word and not turn aside to myths (2 Tim. 4:1-4).

> I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by His appearing and His kingdom: preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with great patience and instruction. For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires, and will turn away their ears from the truth and will turn aside to myths (2 Tim. 4:1-4).

In contrast, wayward men pursue strange doctrines, fruitless discussions, and pointless speculation---the administration of God is furthered by faithful adherence to the divine pattern
(1 Tim. 1:3-7).

> As I urged you upon my departure for Macedonia, remain on at Ephesus so that you may instruct certain men not to teach strange doctrines, nor to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which give rise to mere speculation rather than furthering the administration of God which is by faith. But the goal of our instruction is love from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith. For some men, straying from these things, have turned aside to fruitless discussion, wanting to be teachers of the Law, even though they do not understand either what they are saying or the matters about which they make confident assertions (1 Tim. 1:3-7).

## Conclusion

Let us recognize the authority Jesus Christ as expressed through the inspired apostolic message (1 Cor. 14:37-38).

> If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, let him recognize that the things which I write to you are the Lord's commandment. But if anyone does not recognize this, he is not recognized (1 Cor. 14:37-38).

Let us recognize the perfection of the biblical pattern (2 Tim. 3:13-17; Jas. 1:25).

> But evil men and impostors will proceed from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived. You, however, continue in the things you have learned and become convinced of, knowing from whom you have learned them, and that from childhood you have known the sacred writings which are able to give you the wisdom that leads to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work (2 Tim. 3:13-17).

> But one who looks intently at the perfect law, the law of liberty, and abides by it, not having become a forgetful hearer but an effectual doer, this man will be blessed in what he does (Jas. 1:25).

May we all embrace the unifying facts of the gospel: one God and Father, one Lord, one Spirit, one hope, one faith, one baptism, and also one body (Eph. 4:1-6).

> Therefore I, the prisoner of the Lord, implore you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called, with all humility and gentleness, with patience, showing tolerance for one another in love, being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. There is one body and one Spirit, just as also you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all (Eph. 4:1-6).
