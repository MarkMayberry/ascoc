## Introduction

Key Verse:

> Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion, make my joy complete by being of the same mind, maintaining the same love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose. Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves; do not merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others. Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus, who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men. Being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. For this reason also, God highly exalted Him, and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus EVERY KNEE WILL BOW, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and that every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father (Phil. 2:1-11).

Key Definitions: 

What is selfishness? What is selflessness?

The adjective "selfish" is descriptive "(of a person, action, or motive) lacking consideration for others; concerned chiefly with one's own personal profit or pleasure." 

In contrast, one who is "selfless" is "concerned more with the needs and wishes of others than with one's own" (The Oxford English Dictionary).

## The Problem Is Selfishness

The Greek word *eritheia* occurs seven times in the NT, and rendered "disputes" (2x), "selfish ambition" (3x), "selfishly ambitious" (1x), "selfishness" (1x) in the NASB. It is derived from *erithos* (i.e., day-laborer) and refers to "rivalry, hence ambition" (Thomas, 2052).

Arndt adds that before NT times, it was found only in Aristotle, "where it denotes a self-seeking pursuit of political office by unfair means" (BDAG, 392). Louw and Nida say it refers to "a feeling of resentfulness based upon jealousy and implying rivalry" (88.167).

The selfish person is covetous (Prov. 23:6-8; Luke 12:13-21)

> Do not eat the bread of a selfish man, or desire his delicacies; For as he thinks within himself, so he is. He says to you, "Eat and drink!" but his heart is not with you. You will vomit up the morsel you have eaten, and waste your compliments (Prov. 23:6-8).

> Someone in the crowd said to Him, "Teacher, tell my brother to divide the family inheritance with me." But He said to him, "Man, who appointed Me a judge or arbitrator over you?" Then He said to them, "Beware, and be on your guard against every form of greed; for not even when one has an abundance does his life consist of his possessions. And He told them a parable, saying, The land of a rich man was very productive. And he began reasoning to himself, saying, 'What shall I do, since I have no place to store my crops?' Then he said, 'This is what I will do: I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods. And I will say to my soul, "Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years to come; take your ease, eat, drink and be merry." But God said to him, 'You fool! This very night your soul is required of you; and now who will own what you have prepared?' So is the man who stores up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God" (Luke 12:13-21).

The selfish person is proud (Luke 18:9-14; 1 Tim. 6:3-5)

> And He also told this parable to some people who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and viewed others with contempt: "Two men went up into the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. "The Pharisee stood and was praying this to himself: 'God, I thank You that I am not like other people: swindlers, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector. 'I fast twice a week; I pay tithes of all that I get.' "But the tax collector, standing some distance away, was even unwilling to lift up his eyes to heaven, but was beating his breast, saying, 'God, be merciful to me, the sinner!' "I tell you, this man went to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted" (Luke 18:9-14).

> If anyone advocates a different doctrine and does not agree with sound words, those of our Lord Jesus Christ, and with the doctrine conforming to godliness, he is conceited and understands nothing; but he has a morbid interest in controversial questions and disputes about words, out of which arise envy, strife, abusive language, evil suspicions, and constant friction between men of depraved mind and deprived of the truth, who suppose that godliness is a means of gain (1 Tim. 6:3-5).

The selfish person is jealous (Acts 5:12-18; Phil. 1:12-18)

> At the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders were taking place among the people; and they were all with one accord in Solomon's portico. But none of the rest dared to associate with them; however, the people held them in high esteem. And all the more believers in the Lord, multitudes of men and women, were constantly added to their number, to such an extent that they even carried the sick out into the streets and laid them on cots and pallets, so that when Peter came by at least his shadow might fall on any one of them. Also the people from the cities in the vicinity of Jerusalem were coming together, bringing people who were sick or afflicted with unclean spirits, and they were all being healed. But the high priest rose up, along with all his associates (that is the sect of the Sadducees), and they were filled with jealousy. They laid hands on the apostles and put them in a public jail (Acts 5:12-18).

> Now I want you to know, brethren, that my circumstances have turned out for the greater progress of the gospel, so that my imprisonment in the cause of Christ has become well known throughout the whole praetorian guard and to everyone else, and that most of the brethren, trusting in the Lord because of my imprisonment, have far more courage to speak the word of God without fear. Some, to be sure, are preaching Christ even from envy and strife, but some also from good will; the latter do it out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel; the former proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition rather than from pure motives, thinking to cause me distress in my imprisonment. What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed; and in this I rejoice. Yes, and I will rejoice (Phil. 1:12-18).

## The Solution

### Self-Denial

Jesus said, "If anyone wishes to come after Me, he must deny himself, and take up his cross and follow Me" (Matt. 16:24; Mark 8:34; Luke 9:23). The Greek word *arneomai,* translated "deny," here means "to act in a wholly selfless manner, *deny oneself*" (BDAG, 97).

> Then Jesus said to His disciples, "If anyone wishes to come after Me, he must deny himself, and take up his cross and follow Me" (Matt. 16:24).

> And He summoned the crowd with His disciples, and said to them, "If anyone wishes to come after Me, he must deny himself, and take up his cross and follow Me" (Mark 8:34).

> And He was saying to them all, "If anyone wishes to come after Me, he must deny himself, and take up his cross daily and follow Me" (Luke 9:23).

### Submission

In contrast with the sin of selfishness, biblical submission, which has been described as "voluntary selflessness," is based on the death of pride and the desire to serve another. The Greek Word *hupotassō,* translated "be submissive," means "to place or rank under, to subject, to obey" (Thomas, 5293). 

Note the many ways in which we are to manifest submission, i.e., "voluntary selflessness."

#### Children toward Parents

During his youth, Jesus placed Himself in submission to his mother and father (Luke 2:51-52). In like manner, children---especially those raised in Christian families---should honor and obey their parents (Eph. 6:1-3).

> And He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and He continued in **subjection** to them; and His mother treasured all these things in her heart. And Jesus kept increasing in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men (Luke 2:51-52).

> Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. HONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER (which is the first commandment with a promise), SO THAT IT MAY BE WELL WITH YOU, AND THAT YOU MAY LIVE LONG ON THE EARTH (Eph. 6:1-3).

#### Wives toward Husbands

Wives must submit to their husbands (Eph. 5:24; Col. 3:18; Titus 2:5).

> But as the church **is subject** to Christ, so also the wives ought to be to their husbands in everything (Eph. 5:24).

> Wives, **be subject** to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord (Col. 3:18).

> Older women likewise are to be reverent in their behavior, not malicious gossips nor enslaved to much wine, teaching what is good, so that they may encourage the young women to love their husbands, to love their children, to be sensible, pure, workers at home, kind, **being subject** to their own husbands, so that the word of God will not be dishonored (Titus 2:3 -5).

#### Servants toward Masters

Servants (employees) must submit to their masters (employees) (Titus 2:9; 1 Pet. 2:18-20).

> Urge bondslaves to **be subject** to their own masters in everything, to be well-pleasing, not argumentative (Titus 2:9).

> Servants, **be submissive** to your masters with all respect, not only to those who are good and gentle, but also to those who are unreasonable. For this finds favor, if for the sake of conscience toward God a person bears up under sorrows when suffering unjustly. For what credit is there if, when you sin and are harshly treated, you endure it with patience? But if when you do what is right and suffer for it you patiently endure it, this finds favor with God (1 Pet. 2:18 -20).

#### Citizens toward Civil Rulers

Citizens must be subject to their civil rulers (Titus 3:1; 1 Pet. 2:13-17).

> Remind them to **be subject** to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good deed (Titus 3:1).

> **Submit yourselves** for the Lord's sake to every human institution, whether to a king as the one in authority, or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and the praise of those who do right. For such is the will of God that by doing right you may silence the ignorance of foolish men. Act as free men, and do not use your freedom as a covering for evil, but use it as bondslaves of God. Honor all people, love the brotherhood, fear God, honor the king (1 Pet. 2:13 -17).

#### Congregation toward Elders

Members of a local congregation must submit to its elders (Heb. 13:7, 17).

> Remember those who led you, who spoke the word of God to you; and considering the result of their conduct, imitate their faith (Heb. 13:7).

> Obey your leaders and **submit** to them, for they keep watch over your souls as those who will give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with grief, for this would be unprofitable for you (Heb. 13:17).

### The Paradox of Leadership

If you aspire for leadership, and wish for a position of authority, remember: this obligation goes in both directions: in any mutual relationship, even one with roles of headship and submission, individuals should be mindful of the needs of the other (Eph. 5:21; 1 Pet. 5:1-5).

> and **be subject** to one another in the fear of Christ (Eph. 5:21).

> Therefore, I exhort the elders among you, as your fellow elder and witness of the sufferings of Christ, and a partaker also of the glory that is to be revealed, shepherd the flock of God among you, exercising oversight not under compulsion, but voluntarily, according to the will of God; and not for sordid gain, but with eagerness; nor yet as lording it over those allotted to your charge, but proving to be examples to the flock. And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory. You younger men, likewise, **be subject** to your elders; and all of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, for GOD IS OPPOSED TO THE PROUD, BUT GIVES GRACE TO THE HUMBLE (1 Pet. 5:1 -5).

#### The King toward Citizens

The king serves the nation and its citizens (Eccl. 10:16-17; cf. Isa. 3:4-5). 

> Woe to you, O land, whose king is a lad and whose princes feast in the morning. Blessed are you, O land, whose king is of nobility and whose princes eat at the appropriate time—for strength and not for drunkenness (Eccl. 10:16-17).

> And I will make mere lads their princes, and capricious children will rule over them, and the people will be oppressed, each one by another, and each one by his neighbor; the youth will storm against the elder and the inferior against the honorable (Isa. 3:4-5).

#### Master toward Servants/Customers

The business owner serves his customers and employees (Luke 6:38). 

> Give, and it will be given to you. They will pour into your lap a good measure—pressed down, shaken together, and running over. For by your standard of measure, it will be measured to you in return (Luke 6:38).

> You shall not oppress your neighbor, nor rob him. The wages of a hired man are not to remain with you all night until morning (Lev. 19:13).

> Masters, grant to your slaves justice and fairness, knowing that you too have a Master in heaven (Col. 4:1).

#### Husband/Father toward Family

The husband/father serves his wife and family. It is the duty of husbands to provide their homes with love and leadership (Eph. 5:22-33). As God is the head of Christ, so also is Christ the head of man, and man the head of woman (1 Cor. 11:3). Headship implies both supervision and sustenance (Eph. 4:14-16). Love necessitates sanctification and selflessness (1 Cor. 13:4-7). 

> Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, He Himself being the Savior of the body. But as the church is subject to Christ, so also the wives ought to be to their husbands in everything. Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her, so that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, that He might present to Himself the church in all her glory, having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that she would be holy and blameless. So husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself; for no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also does the church, because we are members of His body. FOR THIS REASON A MAN SHALL LEAVE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER AND SHALL BE JOINED TO HIS WIFE, AND THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH. This mystery is great; but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the church. Nevertheless, each individual among you also is to love his own wife even as himself, and the wife must see to it that she respects her husband (Eph. 5:22-33).

> But I want you to understand that Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of a woman, and God is the head of Christ (1 Cor. 11:3).

> As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness in deceitful scheming; but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all aspects into Him who is the head, even Christ, from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individual part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love (Eph. 4:14-16).

> Love is patient, love is kind and is not jealous; love does not brag and is not arrogant, does not act unbecomingly; it does not seek its own, is not provoked, does not take into account a wrong suffered, does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things (1 Cor. 13:4-7).

#### Elders Toward Congregation

The elders serve the Lord and the needs of the saints congregations (Acts 20:28; Heb. 13:17; 2 Pet. 5:1-6; cf. Isa. 62:6-7).

> Be on guard for yourselves and for all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God which He purchased with His own blood (Acts 20:28).

> Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they keep watch over your souls as those who will give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with grief, for this would be unprofitable for you (Heb. 13:17).

> Therefore, I exhort the elders among you, as your fellow elder and witness of the sufferings of Christ, and a partaker also of the glory that is to be revealed, shepherd the flock of God among you, exercising oversight not under compulsion, but voluntarily, according to the will of God; and not for sordid gain, but with eagerness; nor yet as lording it over those allotted to your charge, but proving to be examples to the flock. And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory. You younger men, likewise, be subject to your elders; and all of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, for GOD IS OPPOSED TO THE PROUD, BUT GIVES GRACE TO THE HUMBLE (1 Pet. 5:1-5).

> On your walls, O Jerusalem, I have appointed watchmen; All day and all night they will never keep silent. You who remind the LORD, take no rest for yourselves; And give Him no rest until He establishes And makes Jerusalem a praise in the earth (Isa. 62:6-7).

## Conclusion

How can we achieve selflessness in the age of selfies? Selfishness is connected with pride. Someone once said, "Selflessness is not thinking less of yourself, but thinking of yourself less." Therefore, let us set proper priorities: (1) God first, (2) others next, (3) self last.

The consequences of selfishness are disruptive in the present (Jas. 3:13-18) and will be damning in the future (Rom. 2:6-11).

> Who among you is wise and understanding? Let him show by his good behavior his deeds in the gentleness of wisdom. But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, do not be arrogant and so lie against the truth. This wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly, natural, demonic. For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there is disorder and every evil thing. But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, unwavering, without hypocrisy. And the seed whose fruit is righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace (Jas. 3:13-18).

> [God] . . . WILL RENDER TO EACH PERSON ACCORDING TO HIS DEEDS: to those who by perseverance in doing good seek for glory and honor and immortality, eternal life; but to those who are selfishly ambitious and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, wrath and indignation. There will be tribulation and distress for every soul of man who does evil, of the Jew first and also of the Greek, but glory and honor and peace to everyone who does good, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. For there is no partiality with God." (Rom. 2:6-11).

In contrast, let us strive (not for preeminence) but to be like Jesus Christ, who perfectly personified selflessness (Phil. 2:1-11).

> Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion, make my joy complete by being of the same mind, maintaining the same love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose. Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves; do not merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others. Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus, who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men. Being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. For this reason also, God highly exalted Him, and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus EVERY KNEE WILL BOW, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and that every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father (Phil. 2:1-11).
