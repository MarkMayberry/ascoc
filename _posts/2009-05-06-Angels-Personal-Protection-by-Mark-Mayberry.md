Introducing the parable of the lost sheep, Jesus said, "See that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I say to you that **their angels in heaven** continually see the face of My Father who is in heaven" (Matt. 18:10-14; cf. Luke 15:3-7). The expression "their angels" of Matthew 18:10 parallels "his angel" of Acts 12:14-15.

> Matthew 18:10-14 ... 10 "**See that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I say to you that their angels in heaven continually see the face of My Father who is in heaven.** 11 ("For the Son of Man has come to save that which was lost.) 12 "What do you think? If any man has a hundred sheep, and one of them has gone astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go and search for the one that is straying? 13 "If it turns out that he finds it, truly I say to you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine which have not gone astray. 14 "**So it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones perish (NASB).**

> Luke 15:3-7 ... 3 So He told them this parable, saying, 4 "What man among you, if he has a hundred sheep and has lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the open pasture and go after the one which is lost until he finds it? 5 "When he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing. 6 "And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost!' 7 "I tell you that in the same way, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance (NASB).

> Matthew 18:10 ... 10 "See that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I say to you that **their angels** in heaven continually see the face of My Father who is in heaven (NASB).

> Acts 12:14-15 ... 14 When she recognized Peter's voice, because of her joy she did not open the gate, but ran in and announced that Peter was standing in front of the gate. 15 They said to her, "You are out of your mind!" But she kept insisting that it was so. They kept saying, "**It is his angel.**" (NASB).

Nevertheless, does this imply some form of angelic guardianship or the promise of providential protection? No. Consider the context of both passages. While Peter was delivered from prison, James was put to death with the sword (Acts 12:1-13). Moreover, Matthew 18:6 implies that the little ones under consideration remained vulnerable: "whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble, it would be better for him to have a heavy millstone hung around his neck, and to be drowned in the depth of the sea." The passage focuses, not on celestial guardianship or the promise of miraculous intervention, but rather upon angelic care and concern (Luke 15:7, 10; 1 Pet. 1:10-12).

> Acts 12:1-13 ... 1 Now about that time Herod the king laid hands on some who belonged to the church in order to mistreat them. 2 And he had James the brother of John put to death with a sword. 3 When he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. Now it was during the days of Unleavened Bread. 4 When he had seized him, he put him in prison, delivering him to four squads of soldiers to guard him, intending after the Passover to bring him out before the people. 5 So Peter was kept in the prison, but prayer for him was being made fervently by the church to God. 6 On the very night when Herod was about to bring him forward, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and guards in front of the door were watching over the prison. 7 And behold, an angel of the Lord suddenly appeared and a light shone in the cell; and he struck Peter's side and woke him up, saying, "Get up quickly." And his chains fell off his hands. 8 And the angel said to him, "Gird yourself and put on your sandals." And he did so. And he said to him, "Wrap your cloak around you and follow me." 9 And he went out and continued to follow, and he did not know that what was being done by the angel was real, but thought he was seeing a vision. 10 When they had passed the first and second guard, they came to the iron gate that leads into the city, which opened for them by itself; and they went out and went along one street, and immediately the angel departed from him. 11 When Peter came to himself, he said, "Now I know for sure that the Lord has sent forth His angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting." 12 And when he realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John who was also called Mark, where many were gathered together and were praying. 13 When he knocked at the door of the gate, a servant-girl named Rhoda came to answer (NASB).

> Matthew 18:1-6 ... 1 At that time the disciples came to Jesus and said, "Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?" 2 And He called a child to Himself and set him before them, 3 and said, "Truly I say to you, unless you are converted and become like children, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven. 4 "Whoever then humbles himself as this child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. 5 "And whoever receives one such child in My name receives Me; 6 but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble, it would be better for him to have a heavy millstone hung around his neck, and to be drowned in the depth of the sea (NASB).

> Luke 15:7 ... 7 "I tell you that in the same way, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance (NASB).

> Luke 15:10 ... 10 "In the same way, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents." (NASB).

> 1 Peter 1:10-12 ... 10 As to this salvation, the prophets who prophesied of the grace that would come to you made careful searches and inquiries, 11 seeking to know what person or time the Spirit of Christ within them was indicating as He predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories to follow. 12 It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves, but you, in these things which now have been announced to you through those who preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven—things into which angels long to look (NASB).

Angels serve the will of God (Ps. 104:4; Heb. 1:7), offering worship (Ps. 103:20-21; 148:2), and on various occasions, rendering service to the saints: protection (Exod. 23:20-22; 2 Kings 6:11-19; Ps. 34:7; 91:11-13; Dan. 3:28; 6:22; etc.), provision (1 Kings 19:5-7; Ps. 78:24-25), instruction (Gen. 16:7-14; 22:11-12, 15-18; Exod. 3:1-2; etc.), and judgment (Exod. 33:2; 2 Sam. 24:15-16; Ps. 35:4-6; 78:49-51; Isa. 37:36; 2 Thess. 1:6-8; etc.).

> Psalm 104:4 ... 4 He makes the winds His messengers, Flaming fire His ministers (NASB).

> Hebrews 1:7 ... 7 And of the angels He says, "Who makes His angels winds, And His ministers a flame of fire." (NASB).

> Psalm 103:20-21 ... 20 Bless the Lord, you His angels, Mighty in strength, who perform His word, Obeying the voice of His word! 21 Bless the Lord, all you His hosts, You who serve Him, doing His will (NASB).

> Psalm 148:2 ... 2 Praise Him, all His angels; Praise Him, all His hosts! (NASB).

> Exodus 23:20-22 ... 20 "Behold, I am going to send an angel before you to guard you along the way and to bring you into the place which I have prepared. 21 "Be on your guard before him and obey his voice; do not be rebellious toward him, for he will not pardon your transgression, since My name is in him. 22 "But if you truly obey his voice and do all that I say, then I will be an enemy to your enemies and an adversary to your adversaries (NASB).

> 2 Kings 6:11-19 ... 11 Now the heart of the king of Aram was enraged over this thing; and he called his servants and said to them, "Will you tell me which of us is for the king of Israel?" 12 One of his servants said, "No, my lord, O king; but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedroom." 13 So he said, "Go and see where he is, that I may send and take him." And it was told him, saying, "Behold, he is in Dothan." 14 He sent horses and chariots and a great army there, and they came by night and surrounded the city. 15 Now when the attendant of the man of God had risen early and gone out, behold, an army with horses and chariots was circling the city. And his servant said to him, "Alas, my master! What shall we do?" 16 So he answered, "Do not fear, for those who are with us are more than those who are with them." 17 Then Elisha prayed and said, "O Lord, I pray, open his eyes that he may see." And the Lord opened the servant's eyes and he saw; and behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha. 18 When they came down to him, Elisha prayed to the Lord and said, "Strike this people with blindness, I pray." So He struck them with blindness according to the word of Elisha. 19 Then Elisha said to them, "This is not the way, nor is this the city; follow me and I will bring you to the man whom you seek." And he brought them to Samaria (NASB).

> Psalm 34:7 ... 7 The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear Him, And rescues them (NASB).

> Psalm 91:11-13 ... 11 For He will give His angels charge concerning you, To guard you in all your ways. 12 They will bear you up in their hands, That you do not strike your foot against a stone. 13 You will tread upon the lion and cobra, The young lion and the serpent you will trample down (NASB).

> Daniel 3:28 ... 28 Nebuchadnezzar responded and said, "Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, who has sent His angel and delivered His servants who put their trust in Him, violating the king's command, and yielded up their bodies so as not to serve or worship any god except their own God (NASB).

> Genesis 16:7-14 ... 7 Now the angel of the Lord found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, by the spring on the way to Shur. 8 He said, "Hagar, Sarai's maid, where have you come from and where are you going?" And she said, "I am fleeing from the presence of my mistress Sarai." 9 Then the angel of the Lord said to her, "Return to your mistress, and submit yourself to her authority." 10 Moreover, the angel of the Lord said to her, "I will greatly multiply your descendants so that they will be too many to count." 11 The angel of the Lord said to her further, "Behold, you are with child, And you will bear a son; And you shall call his name Ishmael, Because the Lord has given heed to your affliction. 12 "He will be a wild donkey of a man, His hand will be against everyone, And everyone's hand will be against him; And he will live to the east of all his brothers." 13 Then she called the name of the Lord who spoke to her, "You are a God who sees"; for she said, "Have I even remained alive here after seeing Him?" 14 Therefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered (NASB).

## Rival Princes

The book of Daniel describes Michael as "the great prince who stands guard over the sons of your people," (Dan. 12:1-3), who struggled with the prince of the kingdom of Persia and Greece (Daniel 10:10-21).

> Daniel 12:1-3 ... 1 "Now at that time **Michael, the great prince who stands guard over the sons of your people**, will arise. And there will be a time of distress such as never occurred since there was a nation until that time; and at that time your people, everyone who is found written in the book, will be rescued. 2 "Many of those who sleep in the dust of the ground will awake, these to everlasting life, but the others to disgrace and everlasting contempt. 3 "Those who have insight will shine brightly like the brightness of the expanse of heaven, and those who lead the many to righteousness, like the stars forever and ever (NASB).

> Daniel 10:1-9 ... 1 In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a message was revealed to Daniel, who was named Belteshazzar; and the message was true and one of great conflict, but he understood the message and had an understanding of the vision. 2 In those days, I, Daniel, had been mourning for three entire weeks. 3 I did not eat any tasty food, nor did meat or wine enter my mouth, nor did I use any ointment at all until the entire three weeks were completed. 4 On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, while I was by the bank of the great river, that is, the Tigris, **5 I lifted my eyes and looked, and behold, there was a certain man dressed in linen, whose waist was girded with a belt of pure gold of Uphaz. 6 His body also was like beryl, his face had the appearance of lightning, his eyes were like flaming torches, his arms and feet like the gleam of polished bronze, and the sound of his words like the sound of a tumult. 7 Now I, Daniel, alone saw the vision, while the men who were with me did not see the vision; nevertheless, a great dread fell on them, and they ran away to hide themselves.** 8 So I was left alone and saw this great vision; yet no strength was left in me, for my natural color turned to a deathly pallor, and I retained no strength. 9 But I heard the sound of his words; and as soon as I heard the sound of his words, I fell into a deep sleep on my face, with my face to the ground (NASB).

> Daniel 10:10-14 ... 10 Then behold, a hand touched me and set me trembling on my hands and knees. 11 He said to me, "O Daniel, man of high esteem, understand the words that I am about to tell you and stand upright, for I have now been sent to you." And when he had spoken this word to me, I stood up trembling. **12 Then he said to me, "Do not be afraid, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart on understanding this and on humbling yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I have come in response to your words. 13 "But the prince of the kingdom of Persia was withstanding me for twenty-one days; then behold, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, for I had been left there with the kings of Persia.** 14 "Now I have come to give you an understanding of what will happen to your people in the latter days, for the vision pertains to the days yet future." (NASB).

> Daniel 10:15-17 ... 15 When he had spoken to me according to these words, I turned my face toward the ground and became speechless. **16 And behold, one who resembled a human being was touching my lips;** then I opened my mouth and spoke and said to him who was standing before me, "O my lord, as a result of the vision anguish has come upon me, and I have retained no strength. 17 "For how can such a servant of my lord talk with such as **my lord**? As for me, there remains just now no strength in me, nor has any breath been left in me." (NASB).

> Daniel 10:18-21 ... 18 Then **this one with human appearance** touched me again and strengthened me. 19 He said, "O man of high esteem, do not be afraid. Peace be with you; take courage and be courageous!" Now as soon as he spoke to me, I received strength and said, "May **my lord** speak, for you have strengthened me." 20 Then he said, "Do you understand why I came to you? But **I shall now return to fight against the prince of Persia;** so I am going forth, and behold, **the prince of Greece is about to come.** 21 "However, I will tell you what is inscribed in the writing of truth. **Yet there is no one who stands firmly with me against these forces except Michael your prince (NASB).**

Members of the satanic/angelic host are referred to as "princes," namely, "the prince of the kingdom of Persia" (Dan. 10:13), the corresponding "prince of Greece" (Dan. 10:20), and also "Michael, the great prince who stands guard over the sons of your people" (Dan. 12:1-2).

> Daniel 10:13 ... 13 "But **the prince of the kingdom of Persia** was withstanding me for twenty-one days; then behold, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, for I had been left there with the kings of Persia (NASB).

> Daniel 10:20 ... 20 Then he said, "Do you understand why I came to you? But I shall now return to fight against **the prince of Persia**; so I am going forth, and behold, **the prince of Greece** is about to come (NASB).

> Daniel 12:1-2 ... 1 "Now at that time **Michael, the great prince who stands guard over the sons of your people**, will arise. And there will be a time of distress such as never occurred since there was a nation until that time; and at that time your people, everyone who is found written in the book, will be rescued. 2 "Many of those who sleep in the dust of the ground will awake, these to everlasting life, but the others to disgrace and everlasting contempt (NASB).

Satan is described as "the ruler of this world" (John 12:31), "the prince of the power of the air" (Eph. 2:1-2), who leads "the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places" (Eph. 6:12). Yet, the outcome of this cosmic struggle is predetermined (Gen. 3:15; Matt. 8:28-29); the devil and his angels are doomed to destruction (Matt. 25:41; Rev. 12:7-17).

> John 12:31 ... 31 "Now judgment is upon this world; now the ruler of this world will be cast out (NASB).

> Ephesians 2:1-2 ... 1 And you were dead in your trespasses and sins, 2 in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to **the prince of the power of the air**, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience (NASB).

> Ephesians 6:12 ... 12 For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places (NASB).

> Matthew 8:28-29 ... 28 When He came to the other side into the country of the Gadarenes, two men who were demon-possessed met Him as they were coming out of the tombs. They were so extremely violent that no one could pass by that way. 29 And they cried out, saying, "What business do we have with each other, Son of God? Have You come here to torment us before the time?" (NASB).

> Revelation 12:7-17 ... 7 And there was war in heaven, Michael and his angels waging war with the dragon. The dragon and his angels waged war, 8 and they were not strong enough, and there was no longer a place found for them in heaven. 9 And the great dragon was thrown down, the serpent of old who is called the devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him. 10 Then I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, "Now the salvation, and the power, and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ have come, for the accuser of our brethren has been thrown down, he who accuses them before our God day and night. 11 "And they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their testimony, and they did not love their life even when faced with death. 12 "For this reason, rejoice, O heavens and you who dwell in them. Woe to the earth and the sea, because the devil has come down to you, having great wrath, knowing that he has only a short time." 13 And when the dragon saw that he was thrown down to the earth, he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male child. 14 But the two wings of the great eagle were given to the woman, so that she could fly into the wilderness to her place, where she was nourished for a time and times and half a time, from the presence of the serpent. 15 And the serpent poured water like a river out of his mouth after the woman, so that he might cause her to be swept away with the flood. 16 But the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and drank up the river which the dragon poured out of his mouth. 17 So the dragon was enraged with the woman, and went off to make war with the rest of her children, who keep the commandments of God and hold to the testimony of Jesus (NASB).

In comparison to the illegitimate and limited power of Satan, Jesus Christ possesses real and rightful authority (Matt. 28:18-20), being the Prince of Peace, the Lord of Lords, and King of Kings (Isa. 9:6; Rev. 17:14; 19:16). God the Father is described in similarly regal terms (Dan. 8:11, 25; 1 Tim. 6:13-16).

> Matthew 28:18-20 ... 18 And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. 19 "Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, 20 teaching them to observe all that I commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age." (NASB).

> Daniel 8:25 ... 25 "And through his shrewdness He will cause deceit to succeed by his influence; And he will magnify himself in his heart, And he will destroy many while they are at ease. He will even oppose **the Prince of princes**, But he will be broken without human agency (NASB).

> 1 Timothy 6:13-16 ... 13 I charge you in the presence of **God**, who gives life to all things, and of **Christ Jesus**, who testified the good confession before Pontius Pilate, 14 that you keep the commandment without stain or reproach until the appearing of our **Lord Jesus Christ**, 15 which **He** will bring about at the proper time—He who is the blessed and only Sovereign, **the King of kings and Lord of lords**, 16 who alone possesses immortality and dwells in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen or can see. To Him be honor and eternal dominion! Amen (NASB).

## Conclusion

While God's people often experienced divine deliverance (Heb. 11:32-34), the faithful frequently faced suffering and sorrow even in Biblical times (Heb. 11:35-38). Furthermore, divine providence and power do not alter the reality that we live in a world of sin and suffering, and that it is appointed unto man once to die (Heb. 9:27).

> Hebrews 11:32-34 ... 32 And what more shall I say? For time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets, 33 who by faith conquered kingdoms, performed acts of righteousness, obtained promises, shut the mouths of lions, 34 quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight (NASB).

> Hebrews 11:35-38 ... 35 Women received back their dead by resurrection; and others were tortured, not accepting their release, so that they might obtain a better resurrection; 36 and others experienced mockings and scourgings, yes, also chains and imprisonment. 37 They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were tempted, they were put to death with the sword; they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated 38 (men of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in deserts and mountains and caves and holes in the ground (NASB).

> Hebrews 9:27 ... 27 And inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once and after this comes judgment, (NASB).

Accordingly, angels should not be viewed as some sort of talisman, i.e., "an object held to act as a charm to avert evil and bring good fortune, or something producing apparently magical or miraculous effects" (Webster). The doctrine of guardian angels goes far beyond divine revelation, entering the mystical realm of human speculation. On this and every other subject, let us contentedly abide in that which is written (Deut. 29:29; 1 Cor. 4:6; 2 Tim. 3:14-17).

> Deuteronomy 29:29 ... 29 "The secret things belong to the Lord our God, but the things revealed belong to us and to our sons forever, that we may observe all the words of this law (NASB).

> 1 Corinthians 4:6 ... 6 Now these things, brethren, I have figuratively applied to myself and Apollos for your sakes, so that in us you may learn not to exceed what is written, so that no one of you will become arrogant in behalf of one against the other (NASB).

> 2 Timothy 3:14-17 ... 14 You, however, continue in the things you have learned and become convinced of, knowing from whom you have learned them, 15 and that from childhood you have known the sacred writings which are able to give you the wisdom that leads to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. 16 All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; 17 so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work (NASB).
