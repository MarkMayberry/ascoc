# Self-Control vs. Its Absence

by Mark Mayberry

## Introduction

In the New Testament, the Greek word *egkrateia* and its related word family express the idea of self-control.

The Greek word *egkrateia*, derived from *egkratēs* (strong, master of, self-controlled), meaning "mastery, self-control" (Thomas, 1466).

BDAG say it refers to the "restraint of one's emotions, impulses, or desires, self-control."

## Acts 24:24–27

> But some days later Felix arrived with Drusilla, his wife who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul and heard him speak about faith in Christ Jesus. But as he was discussing righteousness, self-control and the judgment to come, Felix became frightened and said, "Go away for the present, and when I find time I will summon you." At the same time too, he was hoping that money would be given him by Paul; therefore he also used to send for him quite often and converse with him. But after two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, and wishing to do the Jews a favor, Felix left Paul imprisoned.

## Felix: A Case Study in Failure

In this lesson, let us consider the life of "Antonius Felix," adapted from an article by the same name that appears in *The Lexham Bible Dictionary.*

ANTONIUS FELIX The fourth governor/procurator of Judaea during the time of emperor Claudius and an important figure in the imprisonment of Paul (Acts 23–24).

## Biblical Relevance

Felix played a moderately important role in the life of Paul as the procurator to whom Paul was sent when his life was threatened by a group of religious leaders (Acts 23–24). 

Paul was brought before Felix, who was to judge whether Paul had committed a crime. 

## Neglected Opportunity

Paul's appearance before him presents the opportunity to share his faith in Christ with Felix, who is already familiar with "the way" (Acts 24:22–25).

## Covetous Character

Paul was imprisoned for nearly two years (Acts 24:27), during which time Felix requested to meet with him frequently, apparently in hope that he would receive a bribe (Acts 24:26).

## Repeated Chances, Forfeited

Consequently, Felix's greed gave Paul repeated opportunites to share Christ with him.

Yet, sadly, history offers no evidence that Felix obeyed the gospel.

## Early Years

The early life of Felix is relatively unknown, save for his name (which is contested), that he had a brother, and that he was born a slave and later became a freedman. . . 

## Marriages

Felix was married three times, but the names of only two of his wives are known.

One was the granddaughter of Marc Antony and Cleopatra.

His third wife remains unknown.

## Rise to Power

Felix was assigned as the fourth procurator of Judaea by emperor Claudius and was one of many rulers beginning with Herod the Great (37 BC–4 BC) to have influenced the region.

Claudius appointed Felix at the behest of the high priest Jonathan, who was in Rome protesting Felix's predecessor Cumanus' mishandling of Jewish uprisings. . . 

## Reign in Judaea

Felix was a brutal and firm handed governor over the province of Judaea, ruling from AD 52–60.

Although he was sent to bring the appearance of peace, his reign was rife with violence and uprisings.

## Cruelty

According to Tacitus, Felix ruled without fear of punishment from Rome (Annals, 12.54) and was very cruel: "Antonius Felix practiced every kind of cruelty and lust, wielding the power of a king with the instincts of a slave."

## Societal Collapse

Felix was unable to control the chaos of the province over which he was appointed. 

Although he tried to quell Jewish insurrections, Josephus notes that matters progressively deteriorated.

## Increasing Conflict

Witherington states, "Josephus is quite clear that the net effect of Felix's rule was to add more fuel to the fire."

The situation degraded to the point that Jonathan, the high priest who insisted on Felix as Cumanus's replacement, began to undermine Felix's administration. 

In retribution for Jonathan's outspoken criticism, Felix ordered the Sicarii to murder him.

## Replacement

After the death of Claudius, Nero became emperor and replaced Felix with Festus. 

Although the Jews pressed for Felix to be punished, Nero was reticent because of the influence of Pallas his brother.

## Conclusion

Felix had multiple opportunities to hear the truth, but failed to respond.
