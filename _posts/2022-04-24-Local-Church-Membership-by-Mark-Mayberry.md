## Introduction

In the New Testament, local churches were autonomous and self-governing groups of Christians overseen by shepherds (1 Tim. 3:1-7; Titus 1:6-11). Local congregations are composed of individual members who agree to join together in fellowship (Acts 9:26), worship in a common assembly (1 Cor. 11:18), work out of a common treasury (1 Cor. 16:1-3).

From the moment of his conversion, Saul of Tarsus sought fellowship with fellow-Christians (Acts 9:17-30). 

> [17] So Ananias departed and entered the house, and after laying his hands on him said, "Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road by which you were coming, has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit." [18] And immediately there fell from his eyes something like scales, and he regained his sight, and he got up and was baptized; [19] and he took food and was strengthened. Now for several days he was with the disciples who were at Damascus, [20] and immediately he began to proclaim Jesus in the synagogues, saying, "He is the Son of God." [21] All those hearing him continued to be amazed, and were saying, "Is this not he who in Jerusalem destroyed those who called on this name, and who had come here for the purpose of bringing them bound before the chief priests?" [22] But Saul kept increasing in strength and confounding the Jews who lived at Damascus by proving that this Jesus is the Christ. [23] When many days had elapsed, the Jews plotted together to do away with him, [24] but their plot became known to Saul. They were also watching the gates day and night so that they might put him to death; [25] but his disciples took him by night and let him down through an opening in the wall, lowering him in a large basket. [26] When he came to Jerusalem, he was trying to associate with the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple. [27] But Barnabas took hold of him and brought him to the apostles and described to them how he had seen the Lord on the road, and that He had talked to him, and how at Damascus he had spoken out boldly in the name of Jesus. [28] And he was with them, moving about freely in Jerusalem, speaking out boldly in the name of the Lord. [29] And he was talking and arguing with the Hellenistic Jews; but they were attempting to put him to death. [30] But when the brethren learned of it, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus (Acts 9:17-30).

When Saul/Paul came to Jerusalem, he was trying to **associate** with the disciples (Acts 9:26). The Greek word *kollaō,* here rendered "associate," literally means "to glue, unite" (2853).

Arndt defines it as "(1) to join closely together, *bind closely, unite with or to someone;* figurative extension of the literal meaning 'to glue' or 'join' substances; (2) to be closely associated, *cling to, attach to;* (a) cling (closely) to something; (b) join oneself to. . . associate with; (c) . . .enter into a close relation with. . ." (BDAG, 555-556).

Consider the significance occurence of this word in each occurrence in the following passages (Acts 5:12-14; 9:26-28; 10:23-33).

There is a difference between the close relationship that believers share and the relationship with have with outsiders (Acts 5:12-14).

> [12] At the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders were taking place among the people; and they were all with one accord in Solomon's portico. [13] But none of the rest dared to **associate** with them; however, the people held them in high esteem. [14] And all the more believers in the Lord, multitudes of men and women, were constantly added to their number. . . (Acts 5:12-14).

From the beginning of his ministry, the apostle Paul sought out believers with whom he could associate (Acts 9:26-28). This pattern continued throughout his life (Acts 16:13; 18:1-4).

> [26] When he came to Jerusalem, he was trying to **associate** with the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple. [27] But Barnabas took hold of him and brought him to the apostles and described to them how he had seen the Lord on the road, and that He had talked to him, and how at Damascus he had spoken out boldly in the name of Jesus. [28] And he was with them, moving about freely in Jerusalem, speaking out boldly in the name of the Lord (Acts 9:26-28).

> [13] And on the Sabbath day we went outside the gate to a riverside, where we were supposing that there would be a place of prayer; and we sat down and began speaking to the women who had assembled (Acts 16:13).

> [1] After these things he left Athens and went to Corinth. [2] And he found a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, having recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to leave Rome. He came to them, [3] and because he was of the same trade, he stayed with them and they were working, for by trade they were tent-makers. [4] And he was reasoning in the synagogue every Sabbath and trying to persuade Jews and Greeks (Acts 18:1-4).

The close association of believers (regardless or ethnic or racial differences) is reflected in Peter's explanation to his Jewish brethren of the conversion of Cornelius (Acts 10:23-33).

> And on the next day he (i.e., Simon Peter) got up and went away with them, and some of the brethren from Joppa accompanied him. [24] On the following day he entered Caesarea. Now Cornelius was waiting for them and had called together his relatives and close friends. [25] When Peter entered, Cornelius met him, and fell at his feet and worshiped him. [26] But Peter raised him up, saying, "Stand up; I too am just a man." [27] As he talked with him, he entered and found many people assembled. [28] And he said to them, "You yourselves know how unlawful it is for a man who is a Jew to **associate** with a foreigner or to visit him; and yet God has shown me that I should not call any man unholy or unclean. [29] "That is why I came without even raising any objection when I was sent for. So I ask for what reason you have sent for me." [30] Cornelius said, "Four days ago to this hour, I was praying in my house during the ninth hour; and behold, a man stood before me in shining garments, [31] and he *said, 'Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before God. [32] 'Therefore send to Joppa and invite Simon, who is also called Peter, to come to you; he is staying at the house of Simon the tanner by the sea.' [33] "So I sent for you immediately, and you have been kind enough to come. Now then, we are all here present before God to hear all that you have been commanded by the Lord" (Acts 10:23-33).



## Members of a Body

We are members of a body (1 Cor. 12:14-31).

> [14] For the body is not one member, but many. [15] If the foot says, "Because I am not a hand, I am not a part of the body," it is not for this reason any the less a part of the body. [16] And if the ear says, "Because I am not an eye, I am not a part of the body," it is not for this reason any the less a part of the body. [17] If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the sense of smell be? [18] But now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body, just as He desired. [19] If they were all one member, where would the body be? [20] But now there are many members, but one body. [21] And the eye cannot say to the hand, "I have no need of you"; or again the head to the feet, "I have no need of you." [22] On the contrary, it is much truer that the members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary; [23] and those members of the body which we deem less honorable, on these we bestow more abundant honor, and our less presentable members become much more presentable, [24] whereas our more presentable members have no need of it. But God has so composed the body, giving more abundant honor to that member which lacked, [25] so that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another. [26] And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.[27] Now you are Christ's body, and individually members of it. [28] And God has appointed in the church, first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, administrations, various kinds of tongues. [29] All are not apostles, are they? All are not prophets, are they? All are not teachers, are they? All are not workers of miracles, are they? [30] All do not have gifts of healings, do they? All do not speak with tongues, do they? All do not interpret, do they? [31] But earnestly desire the greater gifts. And I show you a still more excellent way (1 Cor. 12:14-31).

Our hearts should be "knit together" (Col 2:2).

> Colossians 2:2 . . . 2 that their hearts may be encouraged, having been **knit \*together** in love, and attaining to all the wealth that comes from the full assurance of understanding, resulting in a true knowledge of God's mystery, that is, Christ Himself, (NASB).


## Worshippers in a Temple

We are worshippers in a temple (Heb. 2:10-13; Ps. 111:1-10).

> [10] For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things, and through whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to perfect the author of their salvation through sufferings. [11] For both He who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from one Father; for which reason He is not ashamed to call them brethren, [12] saying, "I WILL PROCLAIM YOUR NAME TO MY BRETHREN, IN THE MIDST OF THE CONGREGATION I WILL SING YOUR PRAISE." [13] And again, "I WILL PUT MY TRUST IN HIM." And again, "BEHOLD, I AND THE CHILDREN WHOM GOD HAS GIVEN ME" (Heb. 2:10-13).

> [1] Praise the LORD! I will give thanks to the LORD with all my heart, In the company of the upright and in the assembly. [2] Great are the works of the LORD; They are studied by all who delight in them. [3] Splendid and majestic is His work, And His righteousness endures forever. [4] He has made His wonders to be remembered; The LORD is gracious and compassionate. [5] He has given food to those who fear Him; He will remember His covenant forever. [6] He has made known to His people the power of His works, In giving them the heritage of the nations. [7] The works of His hands are truth and justice; All His precepts are sure. [8] They are upheld forever and ever; They are performed in truth and uprightness. [9] He has sent redemption to His people; He has ordained His covenant forever; Holy and awesome is His name. [10] The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom; A good understanding have all those who do His commandments; His praise endures forever (Ps. 111:1-10).

Each worshipper must sing, pray, and study; on the first day of the week, each must remember the Lord's death, and freely contribute of their means (Acts 12:1-5; Heb. 2:11-12; 1 Cor. 11:17-22; Exod. 35:1; 1 Cor. 16:1-2).

> [1] Now about that time Herod the king laid hands on some who belonged to the church in order to mistreat them. [2] And he had James the brother of John put to death with a sword. [3] When he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. Now it was during the days of Unleavened Bread. [4] When he had seized him, he put him in prison, delivering him to four squads of soldiers to guard him, intending after the Passover to bring him out before the people. [5] So Peter was kept in the prison, but prayer for him was being made fervently by the church to God (Acts 12:1-5).

> [11] For both He who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from one Father; for which reason He is not ashamed to call them brethren, [12] saying, "I WILL PROCLAIM YOUR NAME TO MY BRETHREN, IN THE MIDST OF THE CONGREGATION I WILL SING YOUR PRAISE" (Heb. 2:11-12).

> [17] But in giving this instruction, I do not praise you, because you come together not for the better but for the worse. [18] For, in the first place, when you come together as a church, I hear that divisions exist among you; and in part I believe it. [19] For there must also be factions among you, so that those who are approved may become evident among you. [20] Therefore when you meet together, it is not to eat the Lord's Supper, [21] for in your eating each one takes his own supper first; and one is hungry and another is drunk. [22] What! Do you not have houses in which to eat and drink? Or do you despise the church of God and shame those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? In this I will not praise you (1 Cor. 11:17-22).

> [1] Then Moses assembled all the congregation of the sons of Israel, and said to them, "These are the things that the LORD has commanded you to do. . . (Exod. 35:1).

> [1] Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I directed the churches of Galatia, so do you also. [2] On the first day of every week each one of you is to put aside and save, as he may prosper, so that no collections be made when I come (1 Cor. 16:1-2).

There is no greater duty/task/work we can perform than to collectively praise to the Lord (Ps. 22:22-31; 48:8-14).

> [22] I will tell of Your name to my brethren; In the midst of the assembly I will praise You. [23] You who fear the LORD, praise Him; All you descendants of Jacob, glorify Him, And stand in awe of Him, all you descendants of Israel. [24] For He has not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; Nor has He hidden His face from him; But when he cried to Him for help, He heard. [25] From You comes my praise in the great assembly; I shall pay my vows before those who fear Him. [26] The afflicted will eat and be satisfied; Those who seek Him will praise the LORD. Let your heart live forever! [27] All the ends of the earth will remember and turn to the LORD, And all the families of the nations will worship before You. [28] For the kingdom is the LORD'S And He rules over the nations. [29] All the prosperous of the earth will eat and worship, All those who go down to the dust will bow before Him, Even he who cannot keep his soul alive. [30] Posterity will serve Him; It will be told of the Lord to the coming generation. [31] They will come and will declare His righteousness To a people who will be born, that He has performed it (Ps. 22:22-31).
 
> [8] As we have heard, so have we seen In the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God; God will establish her forever. Selah. [9] We have thought on Your lovingkindness, O God, In the midst of Your temple. [10] As is Your name, O God, So is Your praise to the ends of the earth; Your right hand is full of righteousness. [11] Let Mount Zion be glad, Let the daughters of Judah rejoice Because of Your judgments. [12] Walk about Zion and go around her; Count her towers; [13] Consider her ramparts; Go through her palaces, That you may tell it to the next generation. [14] For such is God, Our God forever and ever; He will guide us until death (Ps. 48:8-14).

## Laborers in a Vineyard

We are laborers in a vineyard ().

> [1] "For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard. [2] "When he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius for the day, he sent them into his vineyard. [3] "And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the market place; [4] and to those he said, 'You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you.' And so they went. [5] "Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did the same thing. [6] "And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing around; and he *said to them, 'Why have you been standing here idle all day long?' [7] "They *said to him, 'Because no one hired us.' He *said to them, 'You go into the vineyard too.' [8] "When evening came, the owner of the vineyard *said to his foreman, 'Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last group to the first.' [9] "When those hired about the eleventh hour came, each one received a denarius. [10] "When those hired first came, they thought that they would receive more; but each of them also received a denarius. [11] "When they received it, they grumbled at the landowner, [12] saying, 'These last men have worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden and the scorching heat of the day.' [13] "But he answered and said to one of them, 'Friend, I am doing you no wrong; did you not agree with me for a denarius? [14] 'Take what is yours and go, but I wish to give to this last man the same as to you. [15] 'Is it not lawful for me to do what I wish with what is my own? Or is your eye envious because I am generous?' [16] "So the last shall be first, and the first last" (Matt. 20:1-16).

> [3] Greet Prisca and Aquila, my fellow **workers** in Christ Jesus, [4] who for my life risked their own necks, to whom not only do I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles; [5] also greet the church that is in their house. Greet Epaenetus, my beloved, who is the first convert to Christ from Asia. [6] Greet Mary, who has worked hard for you. [7] Greet Andronicus and Junias, my kinsmen and my fellow prisoners, who are outstanding among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me. [8] Greet Ampliatus, my beloved in the Lord. [9] Greet Urbanus, our **fellow worker** in Christ, and Stachys my beloved. [10] Greet Apelles, the approved in Christ. Greet those who are of the household of Aristobulus. [11] Greet Herodion, my kinsman. Greet those of the household of Narcissus, who are in the Lord. [12] Greet Tryphaena and Tryphosa, **workers in the Lord.** Greet Persis the beloved, who has worked hard in the Lord. [13] Greet Rufus, a choice man in the Lord, also his mother and mine. [14] Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas and the brethren with them. [15] Greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints who are with them. [16] Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ greet you (Rom. 16:3-16).

> [2] I urge **Euodia** and I urge **Syntyche** to live in harmony in the Lord. [3] Indeed, true companion, I ask you also to **help these women who have shared my struggle in the cause of the gospel,** together with **Clement** also and **the rest of my fellow workers,** whose names are in the book of life (Phil. 4:2-3).

> [22] At the same time also prepare me a lodging, for I hope that through your prayers I will be given to you. [23] **Epaphras,** my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you, [24] as do **Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow workers.** [25] The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit (Phile. 22-25).

## Conclusion


"Also the foreigners who join themselves to the LORD,
To minister to Him, and to love the name of the LORD,
To be His servants, every one who keeps from profaning the sabbath
And holds fast My covenant;
Even those I will bring to My holy mountain
And make them joyful in My house of prayer.
Their burnt offerings and their sacrifices will be acceptable on My altar;
For My house will be called a house of prayer for all the peoples."
(Isa. 56:6-7).

> Colossians 2:2 . . . 2 that their hearts may be encouraged, having been **knit \*together** in love, and attaining to all the wealth that comes from the full assurance of understanding, resulting in a true knowledge of God's mystery, that is, Christ Himself, (NASB).

## Conclusion

How should we understand the function of local congregations? Again, a local church is a group of Christians who have purposefully banded together in order to carry out certain work that God desires for His people to do together. The local church is still composed of individual Christians, but these Christians join together in time and place in order to function as a unit. Intention and purpose are key (Doy Moyer).
