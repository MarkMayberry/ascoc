<h1>God Our Father</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>The Bible oft compares the Heavenly Father to our earthly fathers (Mal. 1:6-8; Heb. 12:4-11).</li><li>The expression, "God our Father" occurs ten times in the New Testament (Rom. 1:7; 1 Cor. 1:3; 2 Cor. 1:2; Gal. 1:3; Eph. 1:2; Phil. 1:2; Col. 1:2; 2 Thess. 1:1; 2:16; Philem. 3).</li></ul>

<h1>Happy Father's Day</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Today, we celebrate "Father's Day." If you are a dad, happy Father's Day! If you are a child, be thankful for your dad, and express your love and affection.</li><li>What stands out about your dad? Is it some amazing ability, like physical strength, or intellectual acumen?</li><li>Perhaps, but in the long run, I venture that his most admirable attributes are muted and mundane (on the surface).</li></ul>

<h1>Our Heavenly Father?</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>What about our Heavenly Father? What stands out? Is it His amazing abilities, as described memorable passages like Isaiah 40:9-31?</li><li>Perhaps, but in the long run, I venture that God's most admirable qualities are expressed in less dramatic prose and poetry. Yes, we serve One who is Omniscient, Omnipotent, and Omnipresent.</li><li>In my judgment, some of the most meaningful affirmations about "God our Father" are embedded in the familiar salutations of the New Testament. Yet, because of our familiarity with this language, such statements are easy to ignore.</li></ul>

<h1>Our God Is an Awesome God!</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Even those OT passages that declare, "Our God is an awesome God," contain statements that may be less dramatic (but no less compelling).</li><li>Hear the declaration of Moses who connected God's greatness with His integrity and impartiality (Deut. 10:17).</li><li>Both Daniel and Nehemiah describe the Lord as "the great and awesome God" who keeps His covenant, maintains a spirit of lovingkindness, and forgives His wayward people when they repent (Dan. 9:4-6; Neh. 1:5-6).</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":1} -->
<h1>Our Heavenly Father is the Source of Grace and Peace</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Seven of Paul's epistles begin with the statement, <strong>"Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ"</strong> (Rom. 1:7; 1 Cor. 1:3; 2 Cor. 1:2; Gal. 1:3; Eph. 1:2; Phil. 1:2; Phile. 3).</li><li>One is abridged, <strong>"Grace to you and peace from God our Father"</strong> (Col. 1:2).</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":1} -->
<h1>Our Heavenly Father</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>He is a God of grace (2 Cor. 9:8-11; 1 Pet. 5:10-11).</li><li>He is the God of peace (Rom. 15:33; 16:20; Phil. 4:4-9).</li><li>He loved us (John 3:16-21; 1 John 4:15-21).</li><li>He comforts us (Isa. 40:1-5; 2 Cor. 1:3-4).</li><li>He gives us good hope (Ps. 42:1-8; Heb. 6:17-20).</li><li>He strengthens our hearts (Heb. 13:7-14; Rom. 1:11-12).</li><li>He makes us productive (Phil. 1:3-6; Col. 1:9-12).</li></ul>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Our Heavenly Father Provides a Relationship in Which We Can Flourish (2 Thess. 1:1-5; cf. 1 Cor. 1:1-9).</li><li>Have you taken advantage of the grace, mercy and love of God? Have you responded to the gospel call? Are you saved from your sins? Are you standing firm in the traditions of Sacred Scripture?</li></ul>
