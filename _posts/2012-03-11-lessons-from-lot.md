<h3><b>By Mark Mayberry     <br />3/11/2012</b></h3>  <h4>Introduction</h4>  <p>When God called Abraham from Mesopotamia to Canaan, he was accompanied by his nephew, Lot (Gen. 11:27-31; 12:4-5; 13:1). </p>  <p>Sacred Scripture describes Lot as “righteous” because he spoke out against the sin of Sodom (2 Pet. 2:4-10). Yet, many of his personal choices were anything other than commendable.</p>  <h4>Companionship may be Destroyed by Conflict</h4>  <p>The life of Lot reminds us that companionship may be destroyed by conflict (Gen. 13:1-7; Prov. 20:3; Phil. 2:14-16; James 3:13-18).</p>  <h4>Character may be Destroyed by Covetousness</h4>  <p>The life of Lot reminds us that character may be destroyed by covetousness (Gen. 13:8-18; 14:1-24; Mark 7:20-23; Luke 12:13-21).</p>  <h4>Children may be Destroyed by Carnality</h4>  <p>The life of Lot reminds us that children may be destroyed by carnality (Gen. 19:1-29, 30-38; 1 Cor. 15:33; Gal. 6:7-8).</p>  <h4>Conclusion</h4>  <p>Warning of judgment, Jesus famously said, “Remember Lot’s wife” (Luke 17:26-33). Let us also recall the sad story of Lot himself. In the end, he lost everything: his wealth, his family, his dignity. Such are the wages of sin. </p>
