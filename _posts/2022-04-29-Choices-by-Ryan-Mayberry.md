## Notes by Mark Mayberry

According to some studies, the average person makes 35,000 decisions over the course of a day.  Decisions that we make can impact the remainder of our lives and potentially determine where we will spend eternity. 

Am I going to dedicate enough time to my spiritual growth (Acts 17:11)?

Will I choose friends who will build me up spiritually or those that tear me down (1 Cor. 15:33)?
 
Will I choose a spouse who will help me spiritually and help me get to heaven, or will I choose someone who will be a detriment my children?

Will I watch that movie filled with language and sex, or will I choose a more wholesome form of entertainment (Phil 4:8)?
  
Will I search for the narrow way that leads to heaven or take the broad and easy highway that leads to hell?
 
Will I choose to serve God, or the idols of the surrounding pagan culture?
