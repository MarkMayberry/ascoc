## Introduction

Some (mistakenly) believe that the devil can control individuals--destroying man's free will, and dominating his actions.

Years ago, Flip Wilson entertained millions with his television portrayal of "Reverend Leroy," the friendly, pompous pastor of the "Church of What's Happening Now," and "Geraldine Jones," the sassy black woman who would justify her excesses by saying, "The devil made me do it!"

In 2021, Hollywood released, *The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It,* supernatural horror film directed by Michael Chaves, with a screenplay by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick from a story by Johnson-McGoldrick and James Wan. It purports to tell the story of two paranormal investigators and authors, Ed and Lorraine Warren, and focuses upon the 1981 murder trial of Arne Cheyenne Johnson in which the defendant claimed innocence for his crime by arguing, "The devil made me do it."

Can the devil force individuals to perform his will? No. God created man in His image. All men possess a free-will. If God chooses to not override man's free will, he certainly does not grant that ability unto Satan.

In the garden of Eden, the serpent planted seeds of doubt in Eve's mind concerning God's honesty/integrity and fairness/justice (Gen. 3:1-5).

> Now the serpent was more crafty than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said to the woman, "Indeed, has God said, 'You shall not eat from any tree of the garden'?" The woman said to the serpent, "From the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat; but from the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden, God has said, 'You shall not eat from it or touch it, or you will die.' " The serpent said to the woman, "You surely will not die! "For God knows that in the day you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil" (Gen. 3:1-5).

Satan's desire is to deceive---appealing to us through the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, but (temporarily) blinding us to the falsity of his claims and his inability to deliver any permanent benefit from his promised pleasures (Gen. 3:6–7, 13; 2 Cor. 11:3).

> When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one wise, she took from its fruit and ate; and she gave also to her husband with her, and he ate. Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loin coverings (Gen. 3:6–7).

> Then the LORD God said to the woman, "What is this you have done?" And the woman said, "The serpent deceived me, and I ate" (Gen. 3:13).

> But I am afraid that, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, your minds will be led astray from the simplicity and purity of devotion to Christ (2 Cor. 11:3).

Satan not only casts aspersions against God, he is also "the accuser of our brethren." As he maligned Job, Satan continues to slander saints in the Christian era (Rev. 22:7-12, esp. v. 10). 

> And there was war in heaven, Michael and his angels waging war with the dragon. The dragon and his angels waged war, and they were not strong enough, and there was no longer a place found for them in heaven. And the great dragon was thrown down, the serpent of old who is called the devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him. Then I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, "Now the salvation, and the power, and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ have come, for the accuser of our brethren has been thrown down, he who accuses them before our God day and night. And they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their testimony, and they did not love their life even when faced with death. For this reason, rejoice, O heavens and you who dwell in them. Woe to the earth and the sea, because the devil has come down to you, having great wrath, knowing that he has only a short time" (Rev. 12:7-12).

## Regarding Moses

The devil contended with Michael the archangel over the body of Moses (Jude 8-10). The Old Testament does not record this encounter, although it is related in an ancient extra-biblical Jewish text entitled the *Testament of Moses.* By alluding to this text, Jude clothes it with the aura of authenticity.

> Yet in the same way these men, also by dreaming, defile the flesh, and reject authority, and revile angelic majesties. But Michael the archangel, when he disputed with the devil and argued about the body of Moses, did not dare pronounce against him a railing judgment, but said, "The Lord rebuke you!" But these men revile the things which they do not understand; and the things which they know by instinct, like unreasoning animals, by these things they are destroyed (Jude 8-10).

Satan fixates on divine justice, but is forgetful of divine mercy. Satan tempts men to rebel against God's decrees, knowing that sin leads to condemnation. However, he dismisses God's loving-kindness and compassion. Moses disobeyed God---striking the rock instead of speaking to it, and taking personal credit for the manifestation of miraculous power instead of giving glory to God. Because of his sin, Moses was not allowed to enter the land of Canaan (Num. 20:1-13).

> Then the sons of Israel, the entire congregation, came to the wilderness of Zin in the first month; and the people stayed at Kadesh. Now Miriam died there and was buried there. There was no water for the congregation, and they assembled themselves against Moses and Aaron. The people thus contended with Moses and spoke, saying, "If only we had perished when our brothers perished before the LORD! Why then have you brought the LORD'S assembly into this wilderness, for us and our beasts to die here? Why have you made us come up from Egypt, to bring us in to this wretched place? It is not a place of grain or figs or vines or pomegranates, nor is there water to drink." Then Moses and Aaron came in from the presence of the assembly to the doorway of the tent of meeting and fell on their faces. Then the glory of the LORD appeared to them; and the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, "Take the rod; and you and your brother Aaron assemble the congregation and speak to the rock before their eyes, that it may yield its water. You shall thus bring forth water for them out of the rock and let the congregation and their beasts drink." So Moses took the rod from before the LORD, just as He had commanded him; and Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly before the rock. And he said to them, "Listen now, you rebels; shall we bring forth water for you out of this rock?" Then Moses lifted up his hand and struck the rock twice with his rod; and water came forth abundantly, and the congregation and their beasts drank. But the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, "Because you have not believed Me, to treat Me as holy in the sight of the sons of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them." Those were the waters of Meribah, because the sons of Israel contended with the LORD, and He proved Himself holy among them (Num. 20:1-13).

When Moses died on Mt. Nebo, he was both honored and humbled. He received an honorable burial by God Himself, but was not permitted to enter Canaan (Deut. 34:1–6). However, this does not mean that Moses died in a state of alienation, separated from God for all eternity. Temporal consequences of sin often remain, but the spiritual consequences of sin can be remitted. 

> Now Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, which is opposite Jericho. And the LORD showed him all the land, Gilead as far as Dan, and all Naphtali and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah as far as the western sea, and the Negev and the plain in the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, as far as Zoar. Then the LORD said to him, "This is the land which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, 'I will give it to your descendants'; I have let you see it with your eyes, but you shall not go over there." So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD. And He buried him in the valley in the land of Moab, opposite Beth-peor; but no man knows his burial place to this day (Deut. 34:1–6).

## Regarding Joshua

Zechariah 3:1–10 records a night vision the prophet experienced in Jerusalem at night, which occurred in the second year of Darius. Zechariah saw Joshua (who led the priests in rebuilding the temple and restoring its sacrifices and service) wearing filthy garments and being accused by Satan. However, the Lord defends His faithful servant, rebuking Satan, and purifying both the High Priest and the Holy City. While Satan seeks defilement as a permanent blot, God provides providing a means by which His people might be cleansed and purified (Zech. 3:1-10). 

> Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him. The LORD said to Satan, "The LORD rebuke you, Satan! Indeed, the LORD who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?" Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and standing before the angel. He spoke and said to those who were standing before him, saying, "Remove the filthy garments from him." Again he said to him, "See, I have taken your iniquity away from you and will clothe you with festal robes." Then I said, "Let them put a clean turban on his head." So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments, while the angel of the LORD was standing by. And the angel of the LORD admonished Joshua, saying, "Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'If you will walk in My ways and if you will perform My service, then you will also govern My house and also have charge of My courts, and I will grant you free access among these who are standing here. 'Now listen, Joshua the high priest, you and your friends who are sitting in front of you—indeed they are men who are a symbol, for behold, I am going to bring in My servant the Branch. 'For behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; on one stone are seven eyes. Behold, I will engrave an inscription on it,' declares the LORD of hosts, 'and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day. 'In that day,' declares the LORD of hosts, 'every one of you will invite his neighbor to sit under his vine and under his fig tree'" (Zech. 3:1-10).

In a similar manner, the current "Cancel Culture" has become a secular religion---maximizing condemnation, minimizing compassion---obsessing over (real or imagined) infractions against an ever-changing moral standard (originating in the minds of our supposed betters). The "Cancel Culture" practices excommunication, but shows no empathy, and offers no route to reconciliation.

## Regarding Christians

In Luke's account of the Last Supper, Jesus informed the disciples of his impending betrayal, passion, and death:

> But behold, the hand of the one betraying Me is with Mine on the table. For indeed, the Son of Man is going as it has been determined; but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed!" And they began to discuss among themselves which one of them it might be who was going to do this thing. And there arose also a dispute among them as to which one of them was regarded to be greatest (Luke 22:21–24).

Despite Peter's assertion, "Lord, with You I am ready to go both to prison and to death!" his prideful overconfidence proved his undoing. Foreshadowing Peter's failure, Jesus said that Satan desired to sift Simon Peter as wheat; yet, the Lord also offered Peter hope (Luke 22:31-34).

> "Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has demanded permission to sift you like wheat; but I have prayed for you, that your faith may not fail; and you, when once you have turned again, strengthen your brothers" (Luke 22:31-32).

Even when Judas betrayed Jesus, and our Lord was taken by His enemies, described as "this hour and the power of darkness," yet, even then, Peter was accountable for his failure of faith (Luke 22:47-53, esp. v. 53).

May we never forget that Satan walks about as a roaring lion, seeking those whom he can devour; yet, though we are imperiled, we are also empowered (1 Pet. 5:6-11). Remember the admonition of James, who said, "Submit therefore to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you" (Jas. 4:7).

> Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you at the proper time, casting all your anxiety on Him, because He cares for you. Be of sober spirit, be on the alert. Your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour. But resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same experiences of suffering are being accomplished by your brethren who are in the world. After you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace, who called you to His eternal glory in Christ, will Himself perfect, confirm, strengthen and establish you. To Him be dominion forever and ever. Amen (1 Pet. 5:6-11).

> Submit therefore to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you (Jas. 4:7).

## Conclusion

There have been times when Satan was allowed to cause physical harm God's faithful followers (cf. Job 1-2). During the time of Christ, demons were permitted to directly inhabit individuals---resulting in an assortment of debilitating emotional, mental, and physical maladies. 

> When they came to the crowd, a man came up to Jesus, falling on his knees before Him and saying, "Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is a lunatic and is very ill; for he often falls into the fire and often into the water. "I brought him to Your disciples, and they could not cure him." And Jesus answered and said, "You unbelieving and perverted generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring him here to Me." And Jesus rebuked him, and the demon came out of him, and the boy was cured at once. Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, "Why could we not drive it out?" And He said to them, "Because of the littleness of your faith; for truly I say to you, if you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move; and nothing will be impossible to you. But this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting" (Matt. 17:14–21)

However, both were unique circumstances. Job's testing/trials teach the value of perseverance. Cases of demon possession in the NT were unique: God allowed Satan greater power in the lives of men, so that the corresponding power of Jesus would be even more evident. 

Also, note the difference: Satan's power is always destructive. Christ's power is constructive. Satan speaks lies; Christ speaks truth. Satan tempts men to sin; Christ encourages men to faithfulness. Followers of Satan will suffer for eternity in hell, while disciples of Jesus will enjoy unending bliss of heaven.

Through prayer and maintaining our focus, we can overcome temptation (1 Cor. 10:13-15). However, we must not be ignorant of Satan's devices (2 Cor. 2:9-11), nor we give the devil an opportunity by pushing past the boundaries of propriety (Eph. 4:26-27).

> No temptation has overtaken you but such as is common to man; and God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will provide the way of escape also, so that you will be able to endure it. Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry. I speak as to wise men; you judge what I say (1 Cor. 10:13-15).

> For to this end also I wrote, so that I might put you to the test, whether you are obedient in all things. But one whom you forgive anything, I forgive also; for indeed what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, I did it for your sakes in the presence of Christ, so that no advantage would be taken of us by Satan, for we are not ignorant of his schemes (2 Cor. 2:9-11).

> BE ANGRY, AND yet DO NOT SIN; do not let the sun go down on your anger, and do not give the devil an opportunity (Eph. 4:26–27).
 
In the end, God wins and the devil loses. Satan's doom is certain. Yet, he can still cause great suffering, inflict great damage, even though he wages a war that will end in certain defeat (Rev. 20:7–15). Which captain/commander will we choose to follow: Jesus Christ, or Satan?

> When the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released from his prison, and will come out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for the war; the number of them is like the sand of the seashore. And they came up on the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city, and fire came down from heaven and devoured them. And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are also; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever. Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat upon it, from whose presence earth and heaven fled away, and no place was found for them. And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life; and the dead were judged from the things which were written in the books, according to their deeds. And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them; and they were judged, every one of them according to their deeds. Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire. And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:7–15).
