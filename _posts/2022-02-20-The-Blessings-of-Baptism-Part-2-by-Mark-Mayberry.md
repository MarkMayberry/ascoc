## Introduction

What does the Bible teach about baptism? The religious world is divided over the question of baptism. How can one know what is right?

It does not matter what we might think. It does not matter what our parents believed. It does not matter what our preacher, pastor, priest, or rabbi might say. It does not matter what man's wisdom might dictate. Remember Naaman the leper. The essential question is, "What does God's word teach about baptism?" On this and every other question, we must go back to the Bible. We must set aside human ideas in favor of a "Thus saith the Lord. . ." Let us, therefore, turn to the Scriptures for instruction and guidance.

The importance of baptism is clearly revealed in the pages of the New Testament. Baptism was a part of the Great Commission (Matt. 28:18-20; Mark 16:15-16). The inspired apostles declare that baptism as a condition of eternal salvation (Acts 2:38; 22:16; 1 Pet. 3:21). It is mentioned in every detailed case of conversion in the Book of Acts.

> And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. "Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age" (Matt. 28:18-20).

> And He said to them, "Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation. "He who has believed and has been baptized shall be saved; but he who has disbelieved shall be condemned (Mark 16:15-16).

> Peter said to them, "Repent, and each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit" (Acts 2:38).

> Now why do you delay? Get up and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on His name (Acts 22:16).

> Corresponding to that, baptism now saves you—not the removal of dirt from the flesh, but an appeal to God for a good conscience—through the resurrection of Jesus Christ (1 Pet. 3:21).

## The Proper Subject

In order for baptism to be valid, it must be performed on a proper subject. Bible baptism involves a person who is accountable, penitent, obedient, and willingly submits to the will of God.

In contrast with New Testament teaching, many denominations practice infant baptism. This custom arose from the tenets of Calvinism. John Calvin, the 16th century reformer, taught that individuals are born into this world totally depraved and full of sin. He affirmed that we inherit the guilt of Adam's transgression. Accordingly, he taught that infants must be baptized to wash away the guilt of original sin.

Although Calvinistic ideas have permeated much of the religious world, the Bible does not support them. God's word states that we suffer the consequences of Adam's sin. Because of his transgressions, we live under the curse of death (Gen. 2:17; 3:16-19; Rom. 5:12-19).

> but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat from it you will surely die"(Gen. 2:17).

> To the woman He said, "I will greatly multiply Your pain in childbirth, In pain you will bring forth children; Yet your desire will be for your husband, And he will rule over you." Then to Adam He said, "Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten from the tree about which I commanded you, saying, 'You shall not eat from it'; Cursed is the ground because of you; In toil you will eat of it All the days of your life. Both thorns and thistles it shall grow for you; And you will eat the plants of the field; By the sweat of your face You will eat bread, Till you return to the ground, Because from it you were taken; For you are dust, And to dust you shall return" (Gen. 3:16-19).

> Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned— for until the Law sin was in the world, but sin is not imputed when there is no law. Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those who had not sinned in the likeness of the offense of Adam, who is a type of Him who was to come. But the free gift is not like the transgression. For if by the transgression of the one the many died, much more did the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one Man, Jesus Christ, abound to the many. The gift is not like that which came through the one who sinned; for on the one hand the judgment arose from one transgression resulting in condemnation, but on the other hand the free gift arose from many transgressions resulting in justification. For if by the transgression of the one, death reigned through the one, much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ. So then as through one transgression there resulted condemnation to all men, even so through one act of righteousness there resulted justification of life to all men. For as through the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the One the many will be made righteous (Rom. 5:12-19).

Nevertheless, we do not bear the guilt of Adam's transgression. Sin in not something we inherit. Children may suffer the consequences of their parents’ wrongdoing, but they do not share the guilt. We are accountable before God as individuals. We will be judged based on our own actions (Ezek. 18:20; Rom. 14:12; 2 Cor. 5:10-11).

> The person who sins will die. The son will not bear the punishment for the father's iniquity, nor will the father bear the punishment for the son's iniquity; the righteousness of the righteous will be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked will be upon himself (Ezek. 18:20).

> So then each one of us will give an account of himself to God (Rom. 14:12).

> For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may be recompensed for his deeds in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad. Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, but we are made manifest to God; and I hope that we are made manifest also in your consciences (2 Cor. 5:10-11).

Sin is a conscious act of transgression (1 John 3:4). Infants are thus incapable of sin, being pure and holy (Matt. 18:3; 19:14). They remain free of sin until reaching the age of accountability (Ezek. 28:15; Eccles. 7:29; Jonah 4:11). Eventually, a child reaches the age when he learns the difference between right and wrong, and rebels against the will of God. At that point, he or she becomes a sinner in need of salvation. Until then, all children are safe.

> Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness (1 John 3:4).

> [Jesus] said, "Truly I say to you, unless you are converted and become like children, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven (Matt. 18:3).

> But Jesus said, "Let the children alone, and do not hinder them from coming to Me; for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these." (Matt. 19:14).

> You were blameless in your ways From the day you were created Until unrighteousness was found in you (Ezek. 28:15).

> Behold, I have found only this, that God made men upright, but they have sought out many devices (Eccl. 7:29).

> Should I not have compassion on Nineveh, the great city in which there are more than 120,000 persons who do not know the difference between their right and left hand, as well as many animals? (Jonah 4:11).

In recent years, some denominations have continued the practice of infant baptism, even though they rejected its original premise. Renouncing the doctrine of original sin and refusing the notion that baptism is essential for salvation, they continue the practice based on tradition. They reason that if infants are fit for the kingdom of God in heaven, they can be members of the church on earth. Therefore, they should be dedicated to God by "christening." However, there is no support for this practice in the New Testament.

Sometimes it is argued that the "household conversions" in the Book of Acts prove infant baptism. However, this argument assumes what it seeks to prove. It is assumed, without evidence, that (1) these households had children, and (2) those children were infants. Such reasoning is flawed and fallacious.

In New Testament times, those who were subject to baptism had to meet certain prerequisites. They had to hear, understand, believe, repent and confess (John 6:44-45; Acts 2:38; 8:12; 16:31-33; Rom. 10:9-10). Infants cannot meet these conditions. Therefore, one can necessarily infer that those individuals alluded to in the cases of household conversions had reached the age of accountability.

> No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him; and I will raise him up on the last day. It is written in the prophets, "AND THEY SHALL ALL BE TAUGHT OF GOD."" Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father, comes to Me (John 6:44-45).

> Peter said to them, "Repent, and each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit" (Acts 2:38).

> But when they believed Philip preaching the good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were being baptized, men and women alike (Acts 8:12).

> They said, "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household." And they spoke the word of the Lord to him together with all who were in his house. And he took them that very hour of the night and washed their wounds, and immediately he was baptized, he and all his household (Acts 16:31-33).

> that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved; for with the heart a person believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth he confesses, resulting in salvation (Rom. 10:9-10).

## The Proper Element

In order for baptism to be valid, it must be performed in the proper element. Bible baptism was administered in water. Another element, such as rose petals or holy oil, cannot be substituted. We can be baptized in flowing water, still water, hot water, cold water, clear water, dirty water, fresh water, or salt water, but it must be water (Matt. 3:16; Acts 8:36; 10:47).

> After being baptized, Jesus came up immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove and lighting on Him (Matt. 3:16).

> As they went along the road they came to some water; and the eunuch *said, "Look! Water! What prevents me from being baptized?" (Acts 8:36).

> Surely no one can refuse the water for these to be baptized who have received the Holy Spirit just as we did, can he? (Acts 10:47).

## The Proper Mode

In order for baptism to be valid, it must be performed in the proper manner. Bible baptism involves a complete immersion of the subject in water. Many religious groups substitute sprinkling or pouring in the place of immersion. However, these alternative actions contradict the meaning of the Biblical word itself.

The Greek word *baptisma,* translated "baptism," derived from *baptizō* (to dip, sink), describes "(the result of) a dipping or sinking," and occurs 20x in the NASB (Thomas, 908).

Arndt defines it as (1) the ceremonious use of water for purpose of renewing or establishing a relationship w. God, plunging, dipping, washing, water-rite, baptism; (a) of John’s rite; (b) of Christian rite. [The person baptized is at the same time buried with Christ Col 2:12]. . ." (BDAG, 165).

> For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one Spirit (1 Cor. 12:13).

Thayer offers this compelling comment about Christian baptism:

> this, according to the view of the apostles, is a rite of sacred immersion, commanded by Christ, by which men confessing their sins and professing their faith in Christ are born again by the Holy Spirit unto a new life, come into the fellowship of Christ and the church (1 Cor. 12:13), and are made partakers of eternal salvation (Thayer, 95).

This truth is also borne out by contextual information in the Bible concerning baptism. For example, John baptized in Aenon because much water was there (John 3:23). You can sprinkle someone with water from a bucket, but immersion requires a large amount of water. The baptism of John was obviously by immersion.

> John also was baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was much water there; and people were coming and were being baptized (John 3:23).

Consider also the story of the Ethiopian eunuch who desired to obey the gospel after hearing Philip's message (Acts 8:36-39). When they came to a suitable body of water, the eunuch asked to be baptized. Both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water. Baptism was administered. Afterwards, they came up out of the water and went their separate ways. Philip went to a lot of unnecessary trouble if he only needed to sprinkle some water on the eunuch's head. Obviously, the eunuch was immersed in water.

> As they went along the road they came to some water; and the eunuch *said, "Look! Water! What prevents me from being baptized?" [And Philip said, "If you believe with all your heart, you may." And he answered and said, "I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God."] And he ordered the chariot to stop; and they both went down into the water, Philip as well as the eunuch, and he baptized him. When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away; and the eunuch no longer saw him, but went on his way rejoicing (Acts 8:36-39).

Finally, consider those passages where baptism is symbolically likened to a burial (Rom. 6:3-4; Col. 2:12) and a planting (Rom. 6:5-7). When a body is buried, it is placed beneath the ground. When a seed is planted, it is covered by soil. Neither sprinkling or pouring are consistent with this imagery. Immersion doesn't, however, fit with these illustrations.

> Or do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death? Therefore we have been buried with Him through baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life (Rom. 6:3-4).

> having been buried with Him in baptism, in which you were also raised up with Him through faith in the working of God, who raised Him from the dead (Col. 2:12).

> For if we have become united with Him in the likeness of His death, certainly we shall also be in the likeness of His resurrection, knowing this, that our old self was crucified with Him, in order that our body of sin might be done away with, so that we would no longer be slaves to sin; for he who has died is freed from sin (Rom. 6:5-7).

## The Proper Reason

In order for baptism to be valid, it must be performed for the proper reason. Bible baptism is for the remission of sins. Some are baptized just to please their parents, their boyfriend, their girlfriend, their husband, or their wife. In many churches, children are baptized to blot out the guilt of Adam's transgression. In other cases, individuals are baptized to become members of a human denomination. Many are baptized as a sign that they have already been saved; in such cases, baptism becomes an outward sign of an inward grace. Each of these concepts is erroneous and unscriptural.

A majority of churches teach that baptism is **not** essential to salvation. Rather, they teach that baptism is an outward sign of the inward work of the Spirit. Members of the Baptist church believe that we are not baptized in order to be saved, but because we are saved.

> Baptism is not essential to salvation, for our churches utterly repudiate the dogma of "baptismal regeneration," but it is essential to obedience since Christ commanded it. It is also essential to a public confession of Christ before the world, and to membership in the church which is his body. And no true lover of his Lord will refuse these acts of obedience and tokens of affection" (*Hiscox Baptist Manual,* p. 20-21).

> Baptists believe that no one is a scriptural subject for baptism till he is already saved (*What Baptist Believe,* p. 37).

### Baptism Stands Between the Sinner and Salvation.

Consider this verse from a grammatical viewpoint. Jesus' statement, as recorded in Mark 16:16, is a complex declarative sentence. "He shall be saved" is the essential statement of the verse. The subject, "He," is modified by the clause "that believeth and is baptized." Belief and baptism are joined by the coordinate conjunction "and" which connects things of equal rank and value. The Lord made both faith and baptism necessary to salvation.

Some might object by saying, "But Jesus only said 'He that believeth not shall be lost.' He didn't say 'He that is not baptized shall be lost.'" Does not this imply that baptism is not essential?" No. There can be no baptism without faith. Consider the following illustration: "He that eateth and digesteth his food shall live; but he that eateth not shall die." Is it necessary to say "He that eateth not and digesteth not his food shall die"? No, digestion is dependent on eating. Just so, the absence of faith makes baptism an utter impossibility.

### Baptism Stands Between the Sinner and Remission of Sins.

Baptists sometimes will argue that the word "for" in this verse means "because of." However, the preposition "for" is translated from the Greek preposition *"eis."* Arndt's definition is helpful. It is used "to denote purpose in order to . . . for the forgiveness of sins, so that sins might be forgiven (Matt. 26:28; Mark 1:4; Luke 3:3; Acts 2:38) (BDAG, s.v. *"eis"* [G1519]).

> for this is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for forgiveness of sins (Matt. 26:28).

> John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins (Mark 1:4).

> And he came into all the district around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins (Luke 3:3).

> Peter said to them, "Repent, and each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38).

### Baptism Stands Between the Sinner and Getting Into Christ.

Since all spiritual blessings are in Christ (Eph. 1:3), and redemption through His blood is in Christ (Eph. 1:7), and salvation is in Christ (2 Tim. 2:10), it is evident that no one can be saved outside of Christ. The saved person is **in** Christ; the unsaved person is **out** of Christ. How does one get into Christ? Through baptism (Gal. 3:27). Those who obey the gospel are added to the church (Acts 2:38, 41, 47).

> Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ (Eph. 1:3).

> In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace (Eph. 1:7).

> For this reason I endure all things for the sake of those who are chosen, so that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus and with it eternal glory (2 Tim. 2:10).

> For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ (Gal. 3:27).

> Peter said to them, "Repent, and each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38).

> So then, those who had received his word were baptized; and that day there were added about three thousand souls (Acts 2:41).

> praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord was adding to their number day by day those who were being saved (Acts 2:47).

### Baptism Stands Between the Sinner and Receiving the Benefits of Christ's Death.

Christ died that men might have salvation (Rom. 5:8-9; Rev. 1:5). No one can be saved apart from the blood of Christ (Heb. 9:22). Jesus said His blood was shed "for the remission of sins" (Matt. 26:28). Peter said we are baptized "for the remission of sins" (Acts 2:38). Is that a contradiction? No. The blood of Christ saves us, but we receive the benefits of His blood in baptism. We are baptized into the death of Christ (Rom. 6:3-4).

> But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from the wrath of God through Him (Rom. 5:8-9).

> and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To Him who loves us and released us from our sins by His blood (Rev. 1:5).

> And according to the Law, one may almost say, all things are cleansed with blood, and without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness (Heb. 9:22).

> Peter said to them, "Repent, and each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38).

> Or do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death? Therefore we have been buried with Him through baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life (Rom. 6:3-4).

### Baptism Stands Between the Sinner and the Washing Away of His Sins.

The conversion of Saul is recorded in Acts chapters 9, 22 and 26. Saul actively persecuted the church. He travelled to Damascus to arrest disciples of the Lord. Along the way, the Lord appeared to him and said, "I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting." Imagine the shock that Saul experienced. He had believed Jesus to be an impostor. Now he learns differently. What was the purpose of this vision? Many would say it was to save him. Yet, Saul was told to "go into the city and there it will be told you what you must do." However, vision came and went, and three days later he was still in his sins. Finding a penitent believer, Ananias said, "And now why are you waiting? Arise and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on the name of the Lord" (Acts 22:16). The real purpose of the vision was to qualify him to serve as an apostle, and be an eyewitness of the risen Savior (Acts 1:21-22; 22:14-15; 26:16). Elsewhere, Paul describes himself as "one born out of due time," i.e., in a supernatural manner. He could offer eyewitness testimony of the risen Savior (1 Cor. 15:3-8).

> Now why do you delay? Get up and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on His name (Acts 22:16).


> Therefore it is necessary that of the men who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us---beginning with the baptism of John until the day that He was taken up from us---one of these must become a witness with us of His resurrection (Acts 1:21-22).

> And he said, "The God of our fathers has appointed you to know His will and to see the Righteous One and to hear an utterance from His mouth. For you will be a witness for Him to all men of what you have seen and heard" (Acts 22:14-15).

> But get up and stand on your feet; for this purpose I have appeared to you, to appoint you a minister and a witness not only to the things which you have seen, but also to the things in which I will appear to you (Acts 26:16).

> For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, and that He appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. After that He appeared to more than five hundred brethren at one time, most of whom remain until now, but some have fallen asleep; then He appeared to James, then to all the apostles; and last of all, as to one untimely born, He appeared to me also (1 Cor. 15:3-8).

What role did baptism play in Saul's conversion? He asked, "What will you have me to do?" The Calvinist would answer, "Why, there is nothing to do! Saul, you're mistaken even to ask such a question. Salvation is not of works. It is wholly by grace." Yet, Saul thought there was something for him to do. The Lord didn't say to him, "Saul, you've got it all wrong." Instead, He answered, "Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what you **must** do" (Acts 9:6). The word "must" carries with it the idea of an imperative, something that is necessary or essential. When Ananias came to Saul, he found a believer who had repented. He told him what he still needed to do: "Arise, and be baptized and wash away thy sins. . . " (Acts 22:16). This is God's simple plan of pardon: Penitent believers are to be baptized.
> but get up and enter the city, and it will be told you what you must do." (Acts 9:6).

> Now why do you delay? Get up and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on His name (Acts 22:16).

### Baptism Stands Between the Sinner and Being Delivered From Defilement.

Through the waters of the flood, Noah and his family were delivered from an old sinful world to a new cleansed environment. In a like manner, we are delivered from an old life of sin into a new life of righteousness through obedience to the Lord in baptism (1 Pet. 3:20–22).

> who once were disobedient, when the patience of God kept waiting in the days of Noah, during the construction of the ark, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through the water. Corresponding to that, baptism now saves you—not the removal of dirt from the flesh, but an appeal to God for a good conscience—through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven, after angels and authorities and powers had been subjected to Him (1 Pet. 3:20-22).

## Conclusion

Have you been scripturally baptized? For baptism to be acceptable, it must be done by Christ's authority (Col. 3:17). It must be performed according to his will. If you were not a penitent believer when you were baptized, your baptism was not scriptural. If you were not baptized in water, your baptism is invalid. If you were not fully immersed in water, your baptism is flawed and defective. If you were not baptized for the remission of sins, your baptism is void. When the apostle Paul found some who had not been baptized correctly, he instructed them to be baptized again (Acts 19:1-5). Do not be like the Pharisees of old, who rejected the baptism of John (Luke 7:30). Do not be like the religious leaders of the first century, who laid aside the will of God in favor of the traditions of men (Mark 7:6-9). Obey God while there is time and opportunity. Submit to his will and be saved. Hear the gospel, believe heaven's message of salvation, repent of your past sins, confess the name of Christ, and be baptized for the remission of your sins.

> Whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks through Him to God the Father (Col. 3:17).

> It happened that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul passed through the upper country and came to Ephesus, and found some disciples. He said to them, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?" And they said to him, "No, we have not even heard whether there is a Holy Spirit." And he said, "Into what then were you baptized?" And they said, "Into John's baptism." Paul said, "John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in Him who was coming after him, that is, in Jesus." When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus (Acts 19:1-5).

> But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected God's purpose for themselves, not having been baptized by John (Luke 7:30).

> And He said to them, "Rightly did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written: 'THIS PEOPLE HONORS ME WITH THEIR LIPS, BUT THEIR HEART IS FAR AWAY FROM ME. BUT IN VAIN DO THEY WORSHIP ME, TEACHING AS DOCTRINES THE PRECEPTS OF MEN.' Neglecting the commandment of God, you hold to the tradition of men." He was also saying to them, "You are experts at setting aside the commandment of God in order to keep your tradition" (Mark 7:6-9).
