## Introduction

In the parable of the prodigal son, Jesus depicts a lifestyle of sinful dissipation (Luke 15:11–16, esp. v. 13).

> And He said, "A man had two sons. "The younger of them said to his father, 'Father, give me the share of the estate that falls to me.' So he divided his wealth between them. "And not many days later, the younger son gathered everything together and went on a journey into a distant country, and there he squandered his estate with **loose living** (Greek: *asōtōs*). Now when he had spent everything, a severe famine occurred in that country, and he began to be impoverished. So he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed swine. And he would have gladly filled his stomach with the pods that the swine were eating, and no one was giving anything to him (Luke 15:11–16, esp. v. 13).

What do we mean by dissipation? To answer this question, let's consider relevant English and Greek definitions, and make application from God's word.

## Relevant English Definitions

### Oxford's English Dictionary

The noun "dissipation" refers to "(1) dissipated living, as in 'a descent into drunkenness and sexual dissipation,' or (2) the squandering of money, energy, or resources, as in 'the dissipation of the country's mineral wealth'" (Oxford English Dictionary).

### Wikipedia

In thermodynamics, dissipation is the result of an irreversible process that takes place in homogeneous thermodynamic systems. In a dissipative process, energy (internal, bulk flow kinetic, or system potential) transforms from an initial form to a final form, where the capacity of the final form to do mechanical work is less than that of the initial form. For example, heat transfer is dissipative because it is a transfer of internal energy from a hotter body to a colder one. Following the second law of thermodynamics, the entropy varies with temperature (reduces the capacity of the combination of the two bodies to do mechanical work), but never decreases in an isolated system.

These processes produce entropy at a certain rate. The entropy production rate times ambient temperature gives the dissipated power. Important examples of irreversible processes are heat flow through a thermal resistance, fluid flow through a flow resistance, diffusion (mixing), chemical reactions, and electrical current flow through an electrical resistance (Joule heating).

## Relevant Greek Definitions

### The Noun

The Greek noun *asōtia,* translated "dissipation" (3x) in the NASB, is a compound of the negative prefix (a-) and *sōzō* (to save). It identifies a state of "unsavedness, i.e., wastefulness" (Thomas, 810).

According to Arndt, "The verb *sōzō* refers to 'preservation,' hence *asōtia* generally denotes 'wastefulness,' then reckless abandon, debauchery, dissipation, profligacy, especially exhibited in convivial gatherings." In the NT, it carries communicates the concepts of "debauchery" (Eph. 5:18), "wild living" (Tit 1:6), and "a flood of dissipation" (1 Pet. 4:4) (BDAG, 148).

Louw and Nida define it as "behavior which shows a lack of concern or thought for the consequences of an action, and recommend it be translated as "senseless deeds, reckless deeds, recklessness" (88.96; 752). They add, "In some languages *asōtia,* in Ephesians 5:18 may be rendered as 'what one does without being able to think about it' or 'what one does when the mind is absent.'"

This word occurs three times in the NT (Eph. 5:15-21, esp. v. 18; Titus 1:5-9, esp. v. 6; 1 Pet. 4:1-5, esp. v. 4).

> Therefore, be careful how you walk, not as unwise men but as wise, making the most of your time, because the days are evil. So then do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is. And do not get drunk with wine, for that is **dissipation,** but be filled with the Spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord; always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father; and be subject to one another in the fear of Christ (Eph. 5:15-21).

> For this reason I left you in Crete, that you would set in order what remains and appoint elders in every city as I directed you, namely, if any man is above reproach, the husband of one wife, having children who believe, not accused of **dissipation** or rebellion. For the overseer must be above reproach as God's steward, not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not addicted to wine, not pugnacious, not fond of sordid gain, but hospitable, loving what is good, sensible, just, devout, self-controlled, holding fast the faithful word which is in accordance with the teaching, so that he will be able both to exhort in sound doctrine and to refute those who contradict (Titus 1:5-9).

> Therefore, since Christ has suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same purpose, because he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin, so as to live the rest of the time in the flesh no longer for the lusts of men, but for the will of God. For the time already past is sufficient for you to have carried out the desire of the Gentiles, having pursued a course of sensuality, lusts, drunkenness, carousing, drinking parties and abominable idolatries. In all this, they are surprised that you do not run with them into the same excesses of **dissipation**, and they malign you; but they will give account to Him who is ready to judge the living and the dead (1 Pet. 4:1-5).

### The Adverb

The Greek adverb *asōtōs,* derived from *asōtia,* describes action performed "wastefully" (Thomas, 811). Occurring once in the NT, it describes the wastefulness of the prodigal son, who "squandered his estate with *loose* living:"

> And He said, "A man had two sons. "The younger of them said to his father, 'Father, give me the share of the estate that falls to me.' So he divided his wealth between them. "And not many days later, the younger son gathered everything together and went on a journey into a distant country, and there he squandered his estate with **loose** (Greek: *asōtōs*) living. Now when he had spent everything, a severe famine occurred in that country, and he began to be impoverished. So he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed swine. And he would have gladly filled his stomach with the pods that the swine were eating, and no one was giving anything to him (Luke 15:11–16, esp. v. 13).

In extra-biblical literature, *asōtōs* was used of "a spendthrift lifestyle," in which one behaves "wastefully, prodigally." It communicated the concept of "a madness that knows no bounds." As an example, one writer cited the lavish provision for the washing of feet with spiced wine (BDAG, 148).

According to Wikipedia, a spendthrift (also profligate or prodigal) is "someone who is extravagant and recklessly wasteful with money, often to a point where the spending climbs well beyond his or her means. "Spendthrift" derives from an obsolete sense of the word "thrift" to mean prosperity rather than frugality, so a "spendthrift" is one who has spent their prosperity. Historical figures who have been characterised as spendthrifts include George IV of the United Kingdom, King Ludwig II of Bavaria, and Marie Antoinette the Queen of France.The term is often used by news media as an adjective applied to governments who are thought to be wasting public money.""

## Application

### Substance Abuse (Prov. 20:1; 23:29-35; Isa. 28:1–8).

> Wine is a mocker, strong drink a brawler, and whoever is intoxicated by it is not wise (Prov. 20:1).

> Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has contentions? Who has complaining? Who has wounds without cause? Who has redness of eyes? Those who linger long over wine, those who go to taste mixed wine. Do not look on the wine when it is red, when it sparkles in the cup, when it goes down smoothly; at the last it bites like a serpent and stings like a viper. Your eyes will see strange things and your mind will utter perverse things. And you will be like one who lies down in the middle of the sea, or like one who lies down on the top of a mast. "They struck me, but I did not become ill; they beat me, but I did not know it. When shall I awake? I will seek another drink" (Prov. 23:29-35).

> Woe to the proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim, and to the fading flower of its glorious beauty, which is at the head of the fertile valley Of those who are overcome with wine! Behold, the Lord has a strong and mighty agent; as a storm of hail, a tempest of destruction, like a storm of mighty overflowing waters, He has cast it down to the earth with His hand. The proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim is trodden under foot. And the fading flower of its glorious beauty, which is at the head of the fertile valley, will be like the first-ripe fig prior to summer, which one sees, And as soon as it is in his hand, He swallows it. In that day the LORD of hosts will become a beautiful crown and a glorious diadem to the remnant of His people; a spirit of justice for him who sits in judgment, a strength to those who repel the onslaught at the gate. **And these also reel with wine and stagger from strong drink: The priest and the prophet reel with strong drink, they are confused by wine, they stagger from strong drink; They reel while having visions, they totter when rendering judgment. For all the tables are full of filthy vomit, without a single clean place** (Isa. 28:1–8).

### Sexual Dissipation (Prov. 5:3-13; 29:3; Luke 15:11-17, 29–30).

> For the lips of an adulteress drip honey and smoother than oil is her speech; But in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword. Her feet go down to death, her steps take hold of Sheol. She does not ponder the path of life; her ways are unstable, she does not know it. Now then, my sons, listen to me and do not depart from the words of my mouth. Keep your way far from her and do not go near the door of her house, or **you will give your vigor to others and your years to the cruel one; and strangers will be filled with your strength and your hard-earned goods will go to the house of an alien; and you groan at your final end,** when your flesh and your body are consumed; and you say, "How I have hated instruction! And my heart spurned reproof! "I have not listened to the voice of my teachers, Nor inclined my ear to my instructors!" (Prov. 5:3-13).

> A man who loves wisdom makes his father glad, but **he who keeps company with harlots wastes his wealth** (Prov. 29:3).

> And He said, "A man had two sons. The younger of them said to his father, 'Father, give me the share of the estate that falls to me.' So he divided his wealth between them. And not many days later, **the younger son gathered everything together and went on a journey into a distant country, and there he squandered his estate with loose living.** Now when he had spent everything, a severe famine occurred in that country, and he began to be impoverished. So he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed swine. And he would have gladly filled his stomach with the pods that the swine were eating, and no one was giving anything to him. But when he came to his senses, he said, 'How many of my father's hired men have more than enough bread, but I am dying here with hunger!'" (Luke 15:11-17).

> But he answered and said to his father, "Look! For so many years, I have been serving you and I have never neglected a command of yours; and yet you have never given me a young goat, so that I might celebrate with my friends; but when **this son of yours came, who has devoured your wealth with prostitutes,** you killed the fattened calf for him" (Luke 15:29–30).

### Financial Dissipation (Prov. 21:17, 20; 23:19–21; 28:7).

> He who loves pleasure will become a poor man; he who loves wine and oil will not become rich. . . There is precious treasure and oil in the dwelling of the wise, but a foolish man swallows it up" (Prov. 21:17, 20).

> Listen, my son, and be wise, and direct your heart in the way. Do not be with heavy drinkers of wine, or with gluttonous eaters of meat; for the heavy drinker and the glutton will come to poverty, and drowsiness will clothe one with rags (Prov. 23:19–21).

> He who keeps the law is a discerning son, But he who is a companion of gluttons humiliates his father (Prov. 28:7).

### Wasted Opportunity (Jer. 8:18–22; Col. 4:5; Heb. 4:1-3).

> My sorrow is beyond healing, my heart is faint within me! Behold, listen! The cry of the daughter of my people from a distant land: "Is the LORD not in Zion? Is her King not within her? Why have they provoked Me with their graven images, with foreign idols? **Harvest is past, summer is ended, and we are not saved."** For the brokenness of the daughter of my people I am broken; I mourn, dismay has taken hold of me. Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then has not the health of the daughter of my people been restored? (Jer. 8:18–22).

> Conduct yourselves with wisdom toward outsiders, making the most of the opportunity (Col. 4:5).

> Therefore, let us fear if, while a promise remains of entering His rest, any one of you may seem to have come short of it. For indeed we have had good news preached to us, just as they also; but the word they heard did not profit them, because it was not united by faith in those who heard. For we who have believed enter that rest, just as He has said, "AS I SWORE IN MY WRATH, THEY SHALL NOT ENTER MY REST," although His works were finished from the foundation of the world (Heb. 4:1-3).

## Conclusion

> Do this, knowing the time, that it is already the hour for you to awaken from sleep; for now salvation is nearer to us than when we believed. The night is almost gone, and the day is near. Therefore, let us lay aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light. Let us behave properly as in the day, not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual promiscuity and sensuality, not in strife and jealousy. But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh in regard to its lusts (Rom. 13:11–14).
