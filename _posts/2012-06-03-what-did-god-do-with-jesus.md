<h2>Introduction</h2>
Various individuals have left their mark upon human history. George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Franklin D. Roosevelt are remembered for their notable accomplishments. Others are less well known. Some are almost forgotten. However, none have had a greater impact than Jesus Christ. None deserve more honor. None are more exalted. What did God do with Jesus?” This question is answered in Ephesians 1:20-23.
<h2>Raised Him From The Dead</h2>
The Old Testament prophesied that Christ would be raised from the dead (Psa. 16:8-10). The New Testament records the fulfillment of this promise (Acts 2:22-32; 13:35-38).
<h2>Seated Him At His Right Hand</h2>
The Old Testament prophesied that Christ would be seated at the right hand of God (Psa. 110:1). The New Testament records the fulfillment of this promise (Mark 16:19-20; Acts 2:33-36; Heb. 12:1-4).
<h2>Put All Things Under His Feet</h2>
The Old Testament prophesied that Christ would put all things under his feet (Psa. 8:3-9). The New Testament records the fulfillment of this promise (Heb. 2:5-9; 1 Cor. 15:25-26; 1 Pet. 3:21-22).
<h2>Gave Him To Be Head Over All Things To The Church</h2>
The Old Testament prophesied that Christ would occupy a position of authority (Gen. 49:10; Isa. 9:6).  The New Testament records the fulfillment of this promise (Matt. 28:18-20; Eph. 5:23-24; Col. 1:18; 3:17).
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
In this lesson, we have sought to answer the question, “What did God do with Jesus?” We want to close by asking two additional questions:

What will Jesus do with you? He will raise you from the dead (1 Cor. 15:12-22). He will seat you in a place of honor (Rom. 2:6-11). He will put you in a position of authority (1 Cor. 6:2-3). He will give you a home in heaven (2 Cor. 5:1-2).

What will you do with Jesus? Will you obey him and be saved (Heb. 5:8-9)? Or will you reject him and be lost (Acts 13:45-46)? The choice is yours. Eternity hangs in the balance!
