<h1 id="thelastenemy%3Adeath">The Last Enemy: Death</h1>

<p>By Mark Mayberry<br/>
6/20/2021</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Through His life, death, burial, and resurrection, Jesus Christ abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel (2 Tim. 1:8&#8211;11).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord or of me His prisoner, but join with me in suffering for the gospel according to the power of God, who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace which was granted us in Christ Jesus from all eternity, but now has been revealed by the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel, for which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher (2 Tim. 1:8&#8211;11)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="victoryprophesied">Victory Prophesied</h2>

<p>The Old Testament contains repeated prophecies foreshadowing Christ&#8217;s victory over death, and the enemy who brought death into the world (Gen. 3:14&#8211;15; Isa. 25:6&#8211;9, 30:26, 35:10, 54:4, 60:15, 61:7).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The LORD God said to the serpent, &#8220;Because you have done this, Cursed are you more than all cattle, And more than every beast of the field; On your belly you will go, And dust you will eat All the days of your life; And I will put enmity Between you and the woman, And between your seed and her seed; He shall bruise you on the head, And you shall bruise him on the heel&#8221; (Gen. 3:14&#8211;15).</p>

<p>The LORD of hosts will prepare a lavish banquet for all peoples on this mountain; A banquet of aged wine, choice pieces with marrow, And refined, aged wine. And on this mountain He will swallow up the covering which is over all peoples, Even the veil which is stretched over all nations. He will swallow up death for all time, And the Lord GOD will wipe tears away from all faces, And He will remove the reproach of His people from all the earth; For the LORD has spoken. And it will be said in that day, &#8220;Behold, this is our God for whom we have waited that He might save us. This is the LORD for whom we have waited; Let us rejoice and be glad in His salvation&#8221; (Isa. 25:6&#8211;9).</p>

<p>The light of the moon will be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be seven times brighter, like the light of seven days, on the day the LORD binds up the fracture of His people and heals the bruise He has inflicted (Isa. 30:26)</p>

<p>And the ransomed of the LORD will return And come with joyful shouting to Zion, With everlasting joy upon their heads. They will find gladness and joy, And sorrow and sighing will flee away (Isa. 35:10)</p>

<p>Fear not, for you will not be put to shame; And do not feel humiliated, for you will not be disgraced; But you will forget the shame of your youth, And the reproach of your widowhood you will remember no more (Isa. 54:4)</p>

<p>Whereas you have been forsaken and hated With no one passing through, I will make you an everlasting pride, A joy from generation to generation (Isa. 60:15)</p>

<p>Instead of your shame you will have a double portion, And instead of humiliation they will shout for joy over their portion. Therefore they will possess a double portion in their land, Everlasting joy will be theirs (Isa. 61:7)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="victoryrealized">Victory Realized</h2>

<p>In the New Testament, these promises were realized, potentially/prospectively at Christ&#8217;s first coming (Heb. 2:14&#8211;15; Rom. 8:37&#8211;38; 16:20; 1 John 3:7&#8211;8), and perfectly/perpetually when He comes again (1 Cor. 15:26, 54; Rev. 20:14; 21:4).</p>

<h3 id="potentiallyprospectively">Potentially/Prospectively</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Therefore, since the children share in flesh and blood, He Himself likewise also partook of the same, that through death He might render powerless him who had the power of death, that is, the devil, and might free those who through fear of death were subject to slavery all their lives (Heb. 2:14&#8211;15)</p>

<p>But in all these things we overwhelmingly conquer through Him who loved us. For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers (Rom. 8:37&#8211;38)</p>

<p>The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you(Rom. 16:20)</p>

<p>Little children, make sure no one deceives you; the one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as He is righteous; the one who practices sin is of the devil; for the devil has sinned from the beginning. The Son of God appeared for this purpose, to destroy the works of the devil (1 John 3:7&#8211;8)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="perfectlyperpetually">Perfectly/Perpetually</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>The last enemy that will be abolished is death (1 Cor. 15:26)</p>

<p>But when this perishable will have put on the imperishable, and this mortal will have put on immortality, then will come about the saying that is written, &quot;DEATH IS SWALLOWED UP in victory (1 Cor. 15:54)</p>

<p>Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire (Rev. 20:14)</p>

<p>and He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there will no longer be any death; there will no longer be any mourning, or crying, or pain; the first things have passed away (Rev. 21:4)</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>Are you prepared for marriage supper of the Lamb? Jesus&#8217;s parables remind us not to presume that we will have a place at the table, but prepare for that great day (Matt. 8:11&#8211;12; Luke 14:15&#8211;24).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I say to you that many will come from east and west, and recline at the table with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven; but the sons of the kingdom will be cast out into the outer darkness; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth (Matt. 8:11&#8211;12).</p>

<p>When one of those who were reclining at the table with Him heard this, he said to Him, &#8220;Blessed is everyone who will eat bread in the kingdom of God!&#8221; But He said to him, &#8220;A man was giving a big dinner, and he invited many; and at the dinner hour he sent his slave to say to those who had been invited, &#8216;Come; for everything is ready now.&#8217; &#8221;But they all alike began to make excuses. The first one said to him, &#8216;I have bought a piece of land and I need to go out and look at it; please consider me excused.&#8217; &#8220;Another one said, &#8216;I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to try them out; please consider me excused.&#8217; &#8221;Another one said, &#8216;I have married a wife, and for that reason I cannot come.&#8217; &#8220;And the slave came back and reported this to his master. Then the head of the household became angry and said to his slave, &#8216;Go out at once into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in here the poor and crippled and blind and lame.&#8217; &#8221;And the slave said, &#8216;Master, what you commanded has been done, and still there is room.&#8217; &#8220;And the master said to the slave, &#8217;Go out into the highways and along the hedges, and compel them to come in, so that my house may be filled. &#8216;For I tell you, none of those men who were invited shall taste of my dinner&#8217;&#8221; (Luke 14:15&#8211;24).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a distinction between those who serve God and those who do not (Mal. 3:16&#8211;18).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then those who feared the LORD spoke to one another, and the LORD gave attention and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before Him for those who fear the LORD and who esteem His name. &#8220;They will be Mine,&#8221; says the LORD of hosts, &#8220;on the day that I prepare My own possession, and I will spare them as a man spares his own son who serves him.&#8221; So you will again distinguish between the righteous and the wicked, between one who serves God and one who does not serve Him (Mal. 3:16&#8211;18)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a distinction between those who accept the Lord&#8217;s invitation and those who do not; there is a difference between who who is properly arrayed and one who is not (Matt. 22:1&#8211;14).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying, &#8220;The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a wedding feast for his son. &#8221;And he sent out his slaves to call those who had been invited to the wedding feast, and they were unwilling to come. &#8220;Again he sent out other slaves saying, &#8217;Tell those who have been invited, &#8221;Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and my fattened livestock are all butchered and everything is ready; come to the wedding feast.&#8217;&#8220; &#8221;But they paid no attention and went their way, one to his own farm, another to his business, and the rest seized his slaves and mistreated them and killed them. &#8220;But the king was enraged, and he sent his armies and destroyed those murderers and set their city on fire. &#8221;Then he *said to his slaves, &#8217;The wedding is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy. &#8216;Go therefore to the main highways, and as many as you find there, invite to the wedding feast.&#8217; &#8220;Those slaves went out into the streets and gathered together all they found, both evil and good; and the wedding hall was filled with dinner guests. But when the king came in to look over the dinner guests, he saw a man there who was not dressed in wedding clothes, and he *said to him, &#8221;Friend, how did you come in here without wedding clothes?&#8220; And the man was speechless. &#8221;Then the king said to the servants, &#8216;Bind him hand and foot, and throw him into the outer darkness; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.&#8217; &#8220;For many are called, but few are chosen&#8221; (Matt. 22:1&#8211;14).</p>
