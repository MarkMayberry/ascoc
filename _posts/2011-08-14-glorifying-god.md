<h3>Glorifying God</h3>  <p><b>By Mark Mayberry     <br />8/14/2011</b></p>  <h4>Introduction</h4>  <p>In this lesson, let us consider what it means to glorify God, a concept communicated by the Greek word <i>doxazō</i>. Derived from the noun <i>doxa</i>, which refers to praise, honor, or glory, the verb <i>doxazō</i> means to esteem (someone or something) as glorious, to clothe in splendor, i.e., to glorify.</p>  <h4>God was Glorified by Jesus Christ </h4>  <p>· God was glorified by Jesus Christ in His birth (Luke 2:20).</p>  <p>· God was glorified by Jesus Christ in His conduct (John 12:28; 17:9-10).</p>  <p>· God was glorified by Jesus Christ in His ministry of healing (Matt. 9:8; 15:31; Mark 2:12; Luke 5:25; 5:26; 7:16; 13:13; 17:15; 18:43; John 11:4).</p>  <p>· God was glorified by Jesus Christ in His ministry of teaching (Luke 4:15; John 16:14; 2 Cor. 3:10).</p>  <p>· God was glorified by Jesus Christ in His suffering and death (Luke 23:47).</p>  <p>· God was glorified by Jesus Christ in His ascension (John 7:39; 12:16; Acts 3:13).</p>  <h4>God is Glorified by Disciples of Christ</h4>  <p>· God is glorified by disciples in our conduct (1 Cor. 6:20).</p>  <p>· God is glorified by disciples in our conviction (1 Pet. 1:8).</p>  <p>· God is glorified by disciples in our ministry/service (Matt. 5:16; John 15:8; 1 Cor. 12:26; 1 Pet. 4:11).</p>  <p>· God is glorified by disciples in our ministry of benevolence (2 Cor. 9:13).</p>  <p>· God is glorified by disciples in our ministry of teaching (Acts 4:21; 11:18; 13:48; 21:20; Rom. 11:13; Gal. 1:24; 2 Thess. 3:1).</p>  <p>· God is glorified by disciples in our suffering and death (John 21:19; 1 Pet. 2:12; 4:16).</p>  <p>· God is glorified by disciples in our worship of praise and prayer (John 14:13; Rom. 15:6; 15:9; Rev. 15:4).</p>  <h4>Conclusion</h4>  <p>Contrast the selfless example of Jesus Christ (John 8:54; Heb. 5:5) with the self-promoting and self-serving attitude of sinners (Matt. 6:2; Rom. 1:21; Rev. 18:7). Jesus both glorified God and was glorified by God in the completion of His ministry (John 12:23; 13:31, 32; 17:1, 4, 5). We both glorify God and are glorified by God in completing our ministry (Rom. 8:30).</p>
