# Knowing God: His Creation

By Jeff Henry (Notes by Mark Mayberry)

## Introduction

We can know God through creation, but our knowledge of His will is not complete without coming to know His will.

This lesson grew out of seeing a documentary on YouTube entitled, “Is Genesis History?”  It was well produced and emphasized the foundational truth that God’s word is reliable, including the biblical account of creation.

This lesson does not seek to glorify the creation itself, as an end in itself, as pagan idols in times past worshipped and served the creation rather than the Creator, and as modern-day evolutionist glorify nature (but deny nature’s God) in our present age.

We recognized that “evolution” occurs, if you define it as a banana evolving into a person.  However, we do observe changes within biblical kinds

## Introduction of Life

In the beginning, God created the light and dark, the skies and seas, the land, the celestial bodies, the birds and fishes, and finally, the animals and mankind.

After the completion of God’s daily work, God saw that it was good. When the six days of creation were complete, God saw that it was very good.  

While the entrance of sin into the world brought death, and disorder, we will live in an orderly world.

## The Purpose

The purpose of the physical creation is to give glory to its Maker (Deut. 10:14; Ps. 104:24; Rev. 4:11).  

The physical creation also exists to call us to our Maker (Deut. 4:19; Ps. 8:3-4; Rom. 1:20).

## Eight Examples from Creation that Reflect the Maker’s Glory

### Bacteria

Bacteria (i.e., micro-organisms) help us digest food and absorb nutrients, and we cannot survive without them.  This invisible world is necessary for physical life to exist.  These things point to God’s invisible nature.  We cannot see God (1 John 4:12), but it is essential that we share a relationship with Him.

Nitrogen in its pure form is deadly, but it is the most common element in the world.  It is non-reactive, which lends stability to physical life.  Nitrogen is held-together by three bonds.  The cycles of nature allow nitrogen to be used and replenished, enabling life to flourish.

### Honey Bees

They have an amazing design, and produce a by-product that is delicious.  Jeff explained the life-cycle of a honey bee, which lasts for approximately 30-60 days.  The are constantly active, from the moment of their birth to the time of their death.  They reflect God’s industrious nature (Phil. 2:12-13).  God calls us to be like Him in this regard, expecting us to be busy and actively in His service.

### Plants

Time-lapse videos of the growth of a seedling into a mature plant is amazing to witness.  With plants, we see God’s patient and long suffering nature (Luke 13:6-9).  God is patient with us, and actively helps us to grow and develop.

### Clownfish and Anemones

Normally, anemones lure fish into its mouth and devour them.  Not so with the clownfish.  The clownfish clean the anemones, and in turn provide nourishment to the host.  This reflects God’s mutualistic nature.  He wants a relationship with Him, and also with each other in the home and in the church (Jer. 7:23).

### Chickadees

When chickadee lays its eggs, they will incubate them based upon the weather, manipulating the time when the chicks hatch based upon weather temperature.  Baby chickadees depend upon the life-cycle of specific caterpillar.  This reflects God’s intelligent nature, which is reflected in nature, but (sadly) not in our own lives (Jer. 8:7). 

### Musk Oxen

They have the warmest natural fiber known to man.  When attacked by wolves, they form a protective circle surrounding their calves.  This reminds us of God’s protective nature (Ps. 34:7-8).

### Ocean Waves

Ocean waves exercise a powerful influence upon the shoreline, but God has put a boundary upon their reach.  This reminds us of God’s powerful nature (Jer. 5:22).  

### Space

Everybody loves the created world, even those who do not acknowledge the creation.  Space is stunning in its expansive, mysterious beauty.  We cannot comprehend the vastness of space.  This is humbling and creates a sense of awe.  for the unbeliever, this is somewhat depressing.  The earth is small as a grain of sand, when compare to the universe, and we are as small as a grain of sand, when compared to the earth.  David connected the dots: God is awesome, we are small; He fills the universe, but is mindful of our needs.  This reminds us of God’s glorious and gracious nature (Ps. 19:1).  

## Look Up and Down

No matter where you look, the grandeur of God can be seen in all creation, from the highest stars to the lowly ant (Isa. 40:26; Prov. 6:6-8).

## Deep Calls to Deep

Buried deep within each man’s soul is a longing to be reunited with His God (Ps. 42:7; Acts 17:22-23; Rom. 1:19).

## Conclusion

We can see evidence of God’s existence and goodness everywhere we look (Gen. 1:1).  The very first verse of the Bible declares God’s existence, and reflects His benevolent goodness.  

If man seeks to know God, he should also seek to know His Son (Col. 1:15-17; Heb. 1:1-3).

On the seventh day, God rested.  God’s rest was good, as was His work.  Jesus offers us rest from our labors.  He is Lord of the Sabbaoth (2 Cor. 5:7).

We are physical creatures by physical birth, but can become new creatures through obedience to the gospel.
