## Introduction

Kids ask the funniest questions:

> "Mom, my belly hurts! Am I pregnant?" asked a 5 year old boy.

> Why do I have two eyes if I only see one thing?

> Why do we have to be born young and grow old, why can't we be born old and get younger?

> Or, consider the following question that a daughter posed to her dad while they were sitting in a restaurant: "Why are we here, Daddy?" Dad replies, "Well, we're here to have lunch!" She responds, "No, no. Why are we here **on this earth**?"

In this lesson, let us consider questions we *should* and *should not* ask.

## Questions We Should Ask

Who am I? Why am I here? What is my purpose? Where am I going? The Bible provides answers to these compelling questions (Ps. 8:1–9; Isa. 1:18–20; Micah 6:6–8).

> O LORD, our Lord, How majestic is Your name in all the earth, Who have displayed Your splendor above the heavens! From the mouth of infants and nursing babes You have established strength Because of Your adversaries, To make the enemy and the revengeful cease. When I consider Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, The moon and the stars, which You have ordained; What is man that You take thought of him, And the son of man that You care for him? Yet You have made him a little lower than God, And You crown him with glory and majesty! You make him to rule over the works of Your hands; You have put all things under his feet, All sheep and oxen, And also the beasts of the field, The birds of the heavens and the fish of the sea, Whatever passes through the paths of the seas. O LORD, our Lord, How majestic is Your name in all the earth! (Psalm 8:1–9)

> "Come now, and let us reason together," Says the LORD, "Though your sins are as scarlet, They will be as white as snow; Though they are red like crimson, They will be like wool. If you consent and obey, You will eat the best of the land; But if you refuse and rebel, You will be devoured by the sword. Truly, the mouth of the LORD has spoken" (Isa. 1:18–20).

> With what shall I come to the LORD And bow myself before the God on high? Shall I come to Him with burnt offerings, With yearling calves? Does the LORD take delight in thousands of rams, In ten thousand rivers of oil? Shall I present my firstborn for my rebellious acts, The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? He has told you, O man, what is good; And what does the LORD require of you But to do justice, to love kindness, And to walk humbly with your God? (Micah 6:6–8).

> And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying: "Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, For He has visited us and accomplished redemption for His people, And has raised up a horn of salvation for us In the house of David His servant— As He spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets from of old— Salvation FROM OUR ENEMIES, And FROM THE HAND OF ALL WHO HATE US; To show mercy toward our fathers, And to remember His holy covenant, The oath which He swore to Abraham our father, To grant us that we, being rescued from the hand of our enemies, Might serve Him without fear, In holiness and righteousness before Him all our days (Luke 1:67–75, esp. vv. 74-75).

## Questions We Should Not Ask

### Why Me?

At first, Job's questions were self-reflective and introspective (Job 3:11; 7:20-21; 9:29).

> Why did I not die at birth, Come forth from the womb and expire? (Job 3:11)

> Have I sinned? What have I done to You, O watcher of men? Why have You set me as Your target, So that I am a burden to myself? Why then do You not pardon my transgression And take away my iniquity? For now I will lie down in the dust; And You will seek me, but I will not be (Job 7:20-21)

> I am accounted wicked, Why then should I toil in vain? (Job 9:29)

As his ordeal continued, and as his supporters became his accusers, Job's questions became accusatory (Job 10:18-19; 13:24; 24:1-4).

> Why then have You brought me out of the womb? Would that I had died and no eye had seen me! I should have been as though I had not been, Carried from womb to tomb (Job 10:18-19)

> Why do You hide Your face And consider me Your enemy? (Job 13:24)

> Why are times not stored up by the Almighty, And why do those who know Him not see His days? Some remove the landmarks; They seize and devour flocks. They drive away the donkeys of the orphans; They take the widow's ox for a pledge. They push the needy aside from the road; The poor of the land are made to hide themselves altogether (Job 24:1-4)

Ultimately, God called Job to account for his insolence (Job 38:1-3; 40:6-7).

> Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind and said, Who is this that darkens counsel By words without knowledge? Now gird up your loins like a man, And I will ask you, and you instruct Me! (Job 38:1-3).

> Then the LORD answered Job out of the storm and said, Now gird up your loins like a man; I will ask you, and you instruct Me (Job 40:6-7).

After recognizing his wrong, Job humbly repented (Job 42:1-6).

> Then Job answered the LORD and said, "I know that You can do all things, And that no purpose of Yours can be thwarted." [Quoting God:] 'Who is this that hides counsel without knowledge?' Therefore I have declared that which I did not understand, Things too wonderful for me, which I did not know. [Quoting God:] 'Hear, now, and I will speak; I will ask You, and You instruct me.' I have heard of You by the hearing of the ear; But now my eye sees You; Therefore I retract, And I repent in dust and ashes" (Job 42:1-6).

### Why Now?

Sometimes, we impatiently wish we lived in another time, another place, another set of circumstances, etc. Instead, we should cultivate a spirit of acceptance, contentment, and patience (Eccl. 7:8–14; Phil. 4:10–14; 2 Cor. 12:7–10).

> The end of a matter is better than its beginning; Patience of spirit is better than haughtiness of spirit. Do not be eager in your heart to be angry, For anger resides in the bosom of fools. Do not say, "Why is it that the former days were better than these?" For it is not from wisdom that you ask about this. Wisdom along with an inheritance is good And an advantage to those who see the sun. For wisdom is protection just as money is protection, But the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the lives of its possessors. Consider the work of God, For who is able to straighten what He has bent? In the day of prosperity be happy, But in the day of adversity consider— God has made the one as well as the other So that man will not discover anything that will be after him (Eccl. 7:8–14).

> But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at last you have revived your concern for me; indeed, you were concerned before, but you lacked opportunity. Not that I speak from want, for I have learned to be content in whatever circumstances I am. I know how to get along with humble means, and I also know how to live in prosperity; in any and every circumstance I have learned the secret of being filled and going hungry, both of having abundance and suffering need. I can do all things through Him who strengthens me. Nevertheless, you have done well to share with me in my affliction (Phil. 4:10–14).

> Because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations, for this reason, to keep me from exalting myself, there was given me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me—to keep me from exalting myself! Concerning this I implored the Lord three times that it might leave me. And He has said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for power is perfected in weakness." Most gladly, therefore, I will rather boast about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may dwell in me. Therefore I am well content with weaknesses, with insults, with distresses, with persecutions, with difficulties, for Christ's sake; for when I am weak, then I am strong (2 Cor. 12:7–10).

## Conclusion

What about *you?* What questions should you be asking? What questions should you *not* be asking?

If you are wavering between obeying the Lord and conforming to the world, you need to heed the question that Ahab posed to the sons of Israel: "How long will you hesitate between two opinions? If the LORD is God, follow Him; but if Baal, follow him" (1 Kings 18:20–21).

> So Ahab sent a message among all the sons of Israel and brought the prophets together at Mount Carmel. Elijah came near to all the people and said, "How long will you hesitate between two opinions? If the LORD is God, follow Him; but if Baal, follow him." But the people did not answer him a word (1 Kings 18:20–21).

Jesus issued the same challenge, when He said, "No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth" (Matt. 6:24).

If you believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God, then you face the same question that Ananias asked Saul of Tarsus: "Now why do you delay? Get up and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on His name" (Acts 22:6–16, esp. v. 16).

> But it happened that as I was on my way, approaching Damascus about noontime, a very bright light suddenly flashed from heaven all around me, and I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?" And I answered, "Who are You, Lord?" And He said to me, "I am Jesus the Nazarene, whom you are persecuting." And those who were with me saw the light, to be sure, but did not understand the voice of the One who was speaking to me. And I said, "What shall I do, Lord?" And the Lord said to me, "Get up and go on into Damascus, and there you will be told of all that has been appointed for you to do." But since I could not see because of the brightness of that light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me and came into Damascus. A certain Ananias, a man who was devout by the standard of the Law, and well spoken of by all the Jews who lived there, came to me, and standing near said to me, "Brother Saul, receive your sight!" And at that very time I looked up at him. And he said, "The God of our fathers has appointed you to know His will and to see the Righteous One and to hear an utterance from His mouth. For you will be a witness for Him to all men of what you have seen and heard. Now why do you delay? Get up and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on His name (Acts 22:6–16).

If you choose the path of rebellion, you need to consider the question that God posed to ancient Israel: "An appalling and horrible thing Has happened in the land: The prophets prophesy falsely, And the priests rule on their own authority; And My people love it so! But what will you do at the end of it?" (Jer. 5:30–31).
