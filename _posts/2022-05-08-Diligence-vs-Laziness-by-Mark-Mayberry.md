## Introduction

In this series of lessons, we have contrasted character strengths and character flaws:

- Integrity vs. Dishonesty
- Selflessness vs. Selfishness
- Self-control vs. Its Absence
- Diligence vs. Laziness

Solomon---except for Jesus Christ, the wisest man who ever lived---emphasized diligence as an approach to every aspect of life (Eccl. 9:10).

> Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might; for there is no activity or planning or knowledge or wisdom in Sheol where you are going (Eccl. 9:10).

While various biblical words communicate this concept, one stands out: The Greek word *spoudē,* derived from *speudō* (to hasten, urge on), occurring 12x in the NT, refers to "swiftness of movement or action, haste, speed" or "earnest commitment in discharge of an obligation or experience of a relationship, eagerness, earnestness, diligence, willingness, zeal."

BDAG says it refers to "(1) swiftness of movement or action, haste, speed; (2) earnest commitment in discharge of an obligation or experience of a relationship, eagerness, earnestness, diligence, willingness, zeal, often in Greco-Roman literature and inscriptions of extraordinary commitment to civic and religious responsibilities, which were frequently intertwined, and also of concern for personal moral excellence or optimum devotion to the interests of others."

Diligence is a mindset which involves one's whole being. Service to God (our highest duty) requires the hand and the heart (1 Chron. 22:19). Service to man requires similar devotion (Eph. 6:5-8). Fulfillment of our various responsibilities in both realms requires a mental, physical, emotional component.

> **Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God;** arise, therefore, and build the sanctuary of the LORD God, so that you may bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD and the holy vessels of God into the house that is to be built for the name of the LORD (1 Chron. 22:19).

> [5] **Slaves, be obedient to those who are your masters** according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in the sincerity of your heart, as to Christ; [6] **not by way of eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart.** [7] With good will render service, as to the Lord, and not to men, [8] knowing that whatever good thing each one does, this he will receive back from the Lord, whether slave or free (Eph. 6:5-8).

Ancient Israel was carried into captivity because their service to God was half-hearted and hypocritical (Jer. 3:6-10). The path restored fellowship required full-commitment (Jer. 29:10-14).

> [6] Then the LORD said to me in the days of Josiah the king, "Have you seen what faithless Israel did? She went up on every high hill and under every green tree, and she was a harlot there. [7] I thought, 'After she has done all these things she will return to Me'; but she did not return, and her treacherous sister Judah saw it. [8] And I saw that for all the adulteries of faithless Israel, I had sent her away and given her a writ of divorce, yet her treacherous sister Judah did not fear; but she went and was a harlot also. [9] Because of the lightness of her harlotry, she polluted the land and committed adultery with stones and trees. [10] Yet in spite of all this her treacherous sister **Judah did not return to Me with all her heart, but rather in deception,"** declares the LORD (Jer. 3:6-10).

> [10] For thus says the LORD, "When seventy years have been completed for Babylon, I will visit you and fulfill My good word to you, to bring you back to this place. [11] **For I know the plans that I have for you," declares the LORD, "plans for welfare and not for calamity to give you a future and a hope. [12] Then you will call upon Me and come and pray to Me, and I will listen to you. [13] You will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart.** [14] I will be found by you," declares the LORD, "and I will restore your fortunes and will gather you from all the nations and from all the places where I have driven you," declares the LORD, 'and I will bring you back to the place from where I sent you into exile" (Jer. 29:10-14).

## Laziness and Sloth

Oxford's English Dictionary defines "lazy" as descriptive of one who is "unwilling to work or use energy," or one who is characterized by a “lack of effort or activity," or one who "shows a lack of effort or care."

Wasteful loss is the byproduct of laziness (Prov. 24:30-34).

> [9] How long will you lie down, O sluggard? When will you arise from your sleep? [10] "A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest"---[11] Your poverty will come in like a vagabond and your need like an armed man (Prov. 6:9-11).

> [30] I passed by the field of the sluggard and by the vineyard of the man lacking sense, [31] And behold, it was completely overgrown with thistles; its surface was covered with nettles, and its stone wall was broken down. [32] When I saw, I reflected upon it; I looked, and received instruction. [33] "A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest," [34] Then your poverty will come as a robber and your want like an armed man (Prov. 24:30-34).

## Boredom

Boredom is a close cousin to laziness. Why do folks become bored? It may result from external circumstances, but it also can arise from improper motivation on our part---a lack of focus, engagement, interest, etc.

It reflects a spirit of ungratefulness and a lack of contentment with present blessings/provision/personalities. Consider Israel in the wilderness wanderings (Num. 11:4-6; 21:5-6). 

> The rabble who were among them had greedy desires; and also the sons of Israel wept again and said, "Who will give us meat to eat? [5] "We remember the fish which we used to eat free in Egypt, the cucumbers and the melons and the leeks and the onions and the garlic, but now our appetite is gone. There is nothing at all to look at except this manna" (Num. 11:4-6).

> The people spoke against God and Moses, "Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no food and no water, and we loathe this miserable food." The LORD sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit the people, so that many people of Israel died (Num. 21:5-6).

Contemplate warnings from the wisdom literature (Prov. 10:26; 12:27; 15:19). As Sherelyn said, "Boredom is wasteful of time that could be used for profitable purposes."

> Like vinegar to the teeth and smoke to the eyes, so is the lazy one to those who send him (Prov. 10:26).

> A lazy man does not roast his prey, but the precious possession of a man is diligence (Prov. 12:27).

> The way of the lazy is as a hedge of thorns, but the path of the upright is a highway (Prov. 15:19).

## Passionate Engagement

The key to sustainable diligence it to embrace your task, not as an automated-robot or a worker-drone but with passion and personal engagement.

Focus on today. Live in the present, giving attention to the task at hand. Don't rush or dawdle, but pace yourself. Prioritize: seek God and serve others (Matt. 6:33-34).

> [33] But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you. [34] So do not worry about tomorrow; for tomorrow will care for itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own (Matt. 6:33-34).

Look for connections and relevance. Mentally embrace the work, understanding that this (seemingly) mundane task is part of a productive whole. Setbacks are often an integral part of achieving success (Phil. 1:12-14).

> [12] Now I want you to know, brethren, that my circumstances have turned out for the greater progress of the gospel, [13] so that my imprisonment in the cause of Christ has become well known throughout the whole praetorian guard and to everyone else, [14] and that most of the brethren, trusting in the Lord because of my imprisonment, have far more courage to speak the word of God without fear (Phil. 1:12-14).

Satisfaction in life is not divorced from duty, but we find fulfillment in the same (Eccl. 5:12; 9:10).

> The sleep of the working man is pleasant, whether he eats little or much; but the full stomach of the rich man does not allow him to sleep (Eccl. 5:12).

> Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might; for there is no activity or planning or knowledge or wisdom in Sheol where you are going (Eccl. 9:10).

A wise man looks well to the ways of his flocks (Prov. 27:23). Faithful stewards fulfill their charge (1 Chron. 27:25-31). 

> Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, and look well to thy herds (Prov. 27:23, KJV).

> [25] Now Azmaveth the son of Adiel had charge of the king's storehouses. And Jonathan the son of Uzziah had charge of the storehouses in the country, in the cities, in the villages and in the towers. [26] Ezri the son of Chelub had charge of the agricultural workers who tilled the soil. [27] Shimei the Ramathite had charge of the vineyards; and Zabdi the Shiphmite had charge of the produce of the vineyards stored in the wine cellars. [28] Baal-hanan the Gederite had charge of the olive and sycamore trees in the Shephelah; and Joash had charge of the stores of oil. [29] Shitrai the Sharonite had charge of the cattle which were grazing in Sharon; and Shaphat the son of Adlai had charge of the cattle in the valleys. [30] Obil the Ishmaelite had charge of the camels; and Jehdeiah the Meronothite had charge of the donkeys. [31] Jaziz the Hagrite had charge of the flocks. All these were overseers of the property which belonged to King David.

Yet, in addition to external tasks, such an individual also devotes time to important relationship: wife and children, brethren and friends, etc. Jesus Christ, the Good Shepherd, watches over His flock (Ezek. 34:23-24).

> [23] Then I will set over them one shepherd, My servant David, and he will feed them; he will feed them himself and be their shepherd. [24] And I, the LORD, will be their God, and My servant David will be prince among them; I the LORD have spoken (Ezek. 34:23-24).

In restoring Simon Peter, Jesus commanded, "Shepherd/tend My sheep" (John 21:15-17)

> [15] So when they had finished breakfast, Jesus *said to Simon Peter, "Simon, son of John, do you love Me more than these?" He *said to Him, "Yes, Lord; You know that I love You." He *said to him, "Tend My lambs." [16] He *said to him again a second time, "Simon, son of John, do you love Me?" He *said to Him, "Yes, Lord; You know that I love You." He *said to him, "Shepherd My sheep." [17] He *said to him the third time, "Simon, son of John, do you love Me?" Peter was grieved because He said to him the third time, "Do you love Me?" And he said to Him, "Lord, You know all things; You know that I love You." Jesus *said to him, "Tend My sheep" (John 21:15-17).

This mandate to elders of a local church, and by extension, to fathers in their leadership role in the home (1 Peter 5:1-4).

> [1] Therefore, I exhort the elders among you, as your fellow elder and witness of the sufferings of Christ, and a partaker also of the glory that is to be revealed, [2] shepherd the flock of God among you, exercising oversight not under compulsion, but voluntarily, according to the will of God; and not for sordid gain, but with eagerness; [3] nor yet as lording it over those allotted to your charge, but proving to be examples to the flock. [4] And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory (1 Peter 5:1-4).

## Strive for Balance

Don't settle for too little. Avoid the wastefulness of sloth. Don't try to do too much. Avoid the ineffectiveness of haste. While it is good to be active, let's make sure that we allocate our time properly between service to God and the church, family relationships and obligations, work responsibilities, sports activities and hobbies, relaxation and entertainment, etc. Finally, don't be afraid to act. Avoid the paralyzation of fear. Fear is paralyzing. Don't be afraid to participate because you doubt your ability. Do your best today, and you will be better tomorrow.

## Conclusion

On this day of appreciation, let us be thankful for the devoted efforts of our mothers. Christian women are typically models of diligence and devotion (Prov. 31:10-31).

> [10] An excellent wife, who can find? For her worth is far above jewels. [11] The heart of her husband trusts in her, And he will have no lack of gain. [12] She does him good and not evil All the days of her life. [13] She looks for wool and flax And works with her hands in delight. [14] She is like merchant ships; She brings her food from afar. [15] She rises also while it is still night And gives food to her household And portions to her maidens. [16] She considers a field and buys it; From her earnings she plants a vineyard. [17] She girds herself with strength And makes her arms strong. [18] She senses that her gain is good; Her lamp does not go out at night. [19] She stretches out her hands to the distaff, And her hands grasp the spindle. [20] She extends her hand to the poor, And she stretches out her hands to the needy. [21] She is not afraid of the snow for her household, For all her household are clothed with scarlet. [22] She makes coverings for herself; Her clothing is fine linen and purple. [23] Her husband is known in the gates, When he sits among the elders of the land. [24] She makes linen garments and sells them, And supplies belts to the tradesmen. [25] Strength and dignity are her clothing, And she smiles at the future. [26] She opens her mouth in wisdom, And the teaching of kindness is on her tongue. [27] She looks well to the ways of her household, And does not eat the bread of idleness. [28] Her children rise up and bless her; Her husband also, and he praises her, saying: [29] "Many daughters have done nobly, But you excel them all." [30] Charm is deceitful and beauty is vain, But a woman who fears the LORD, she shall be praised. [31] Give her the product of her hands, And let her works praise her in the gates. (Prov. 31:10-31).
