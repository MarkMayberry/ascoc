Introduction

The New Testament speaks of vibrant disciples and congregations (John 10:10; Acts 16:4-5). Both are described in the Greek with a collection of words that mean “to super-abound.” What are the characteristics of such groups and individuals?

The Greek noun perissos, translated “abundantly” in John 10:10, pertains to that which is not ordinarily encountered, i.e., extraordinary or remarkable, or that which occurs in an extraordinary amount, i.e., abundant or profuse [BDAG]. The Greek verb perisseuō, translated “increasing” in Acts 16:5, means to be in abundance, i.e., abound, or to cause something to exist in abundance, i.e., to cause to abound [BDAG].

Are Super-Abundant in Faith

Churches that grow are super-abundant in faith (Col. 2:6-7). Such comes from hearing the Word of God (Rom. 10:17). Like the father of the demon-possessed child, we occasionally cry out, “Lord, I believe; help my unbelief!” (Mark 9:20-24). However, if we evidence patience and steadfastness, faith will be ever-enlarged, and – with the passage of time – weakness will be swallowed up in strength (2 Thess. 1:3).

Are Super-Abundant in Love

Churches that grow are super-abundant in love. Christian love [agape] has two distinct objects: the Truth (Phil. 1:9-11; 2 Thess. 2:10-12), and the brethren (1 Thess. 3:12-13; 4:9-10). Such causes us to seek the highest good of the Lord and also of our brethren.

Are Super-Abundant in Courage

Churches that grow are super-abundant in courage (Phil. 1:12-14). In times of crisis, when sifted like wheat, many like Peter deny the Lord (Luke 22:31-32, 54-62). Yet, with the passing of time, Peter became a pillar of courage and conviction (Acts 4:13-22). 

Are Super-Abundant in Righteousness

Churches that grow are super-abundant in righteousness (Matt. 5:20). We must individually strive to develop an upright character (Matt. 5:6). Righteousness must be pursued, even to the point of persecution (Matt. 5:10). This must be our first priority (Matt. 6:33).

Are Super-Abundant in Rejoicing

Churches that grow are super-abundant in rejoicing (2 Cor. 7:13; Phil. 1:25-26). Morose and sullen groups will never grow. Hospitality, the love of strangers, makes visitors feel welcome in our assembly. Therefore, we must be given to hospitality, evidencing our joy (Rom. 12:13; 1 Pet. 4:9).

Are Super-Abundant In Givers

Churches that grow are super-abundant in givers (2 Cor. 8:1-7; 9:6-9). The work of the church is carried on through free-will offerings (1 Cor. 16:1-2). Therefore, let us all give liberally to the cause of Christ (Rom. 12:6-9).

Are Super-Abundant In Workers

Churches that grow are super-abundant in workers (1 Cor. 15:58). Like Jesus, we should recognize the urgency of serving God (John 9:4). He found great satisfaction and enjoyment in doing the will of the Father (John 4:34). Therefore, let us walk in wisdom toward outsiders, redeeming the time, taking advantage of each opportunity (Col. 4:5).

Conclusion

Super-abundant churches are made up of super-abundant individuals. God will richly bless us if we freely give ourselves in His service. However, His hand of blessing will be removed if we misuse our time, talents and resources (Matt. 13:12; 25:29).
