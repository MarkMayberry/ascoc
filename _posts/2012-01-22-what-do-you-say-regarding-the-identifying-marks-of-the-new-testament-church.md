<h4>Introduction</h4>
What do you say when people ask you about the church? Are you prepared to give an answer concerning the hope that is in you, yet with gentleness and reverence (1 Pet. 3:15)? Is it possible to find simple and pure New Testament Christianity in a religious world filled with conflict, confusion, and division? Does the church that Christ established still exist today? Can it be identified? The answer to these questions is a resounding “Yes!”

The church of Jesus Christ was established according to the eternal purpose of God (Eph. 3:8-11). The kingdom of God will stand forever (Dan. 2:44; Heb. 12:28). From a Biblical standpoint, the church and the kingdom are synonymous (Matt. 16:18-19; Col. 1:13-14, 18). Therefore, we can be confident that the church of our Lord still exists today.

Yet, the question remains, “How can the Lord’s church be identified?” By studying the divine pattern. Let us, therefore, search the Scriptures for those identifying characteristics of the New Testament church. The church that conforms itself to this divine pattern is the church that Christ will accept as His own.
<h4>Its Establishment</h4>
The New Testament Church was founded by Christ (Matt. 16:16-18; Acts 20:28) in Jerusalem (Isa. 2:1-3; Luke 24:46-49) on the first Pentecost after the resurrection of Jesus (Acts 1:4-9; 2:1-4, 14-17, 32, 36-41, 47).

However, churches of men have the wrong founders (Martin Luther, John Wesley, Joseph Smith, Charles T. Russell, etc.). Moreover, they were founded in the wrong places (Rome, Europe, England, and America) and at the wrong times (16th-20th centuries).
<h4>Its Designations</h4>
The New Testament Church was called by the following names: The church of God (1 Cor. 1:2); the churches of Christ (Rom. 16:16); the kingdom of His dear Son (Col. 1:13-14); the body of Christ (Eph. 1:22-23); the temple of God (Eph. 2:19-21); the bride of Christ (Eph. 5:22-33); the household of God (1 Tim. 3:15); the vineyard of the Lord (Matt. 20:1-2). Individually members of the Lord’s church are called disciples or Christians. Notice how all these names give glory and honor to either the Father or His Son.

Each of these names suggest something of the relationship we share with God and one another. For example, the word “church” indicates that we are “called out” of the world to serve Christ. The expression “house of God” indicates that we are born again into His spiritual house or family. The phrase “body of Christ” indicates that we together compose the body over which Christ is the head. The title “kingdom of God” reveals that Christ is our Lord, Ruler and King. In turn, we must be His loyal subjects.

In contrast, churches of men wear names that often glorify some man, idea, or method. For example, the Lutheran church honors the name of Martin Luther, the great Protestant reformer. Presbyterians honor a certain form of church government espoused by their founder John Calvin. The Baptists honor immersion more than the one who ordained it. The Pentecostals idealize the miracles of Pentecost above the teachings they were to confirm.
<h4>Its Rule Of Faith</h4>
The church that is pleasing to God will follow the New Testament as its only rule of faith and practice (Rom. 1:16-17; 2 Tim. 3:14-17; 1 Pet. 4:11). Faithful disciples of Christ will not add to, diminish from, or change God’s commandments in any way (Matt. 15:7-9; Gal. 1:6-9; 2 John 9).

However, churches of men often follow man-made creeds and human traditions. They show a lack of respect for God’s Word by changing it to suit their own preferences. They choose what commandments they will obey, and ignore the rest.
<h4>Its Worship</h4>
The New Testament Church worshipped as God directed. Early disciples partook of the Lord’s Supper on the first day of the week (Acts 20:7; 1 Cor. 11:23-25). They also generously contributed of their means (1 Cor. 16:1-2; 2 Cor. 9:6-7). They lifted their voices in psalms, hymns and spiritual songs (Eph. 5:18-19; Col. 3:16). They offered up prayers and supplications unto God (Phil. 4:6-7; 1 Tim. 2:8). They devoted themselves to the proclamation of God’s Word (Acts 2:42; 2 Tim. 2:2).

However, modern day denominations have changed the worship of the New Testament church in more ways than Jeroboam perverted the worship of ancient Israel. They have altered the frequency of the Lord’s supper, its elements, and its purpose. They have added instrumental music to the singing. They insist upon tithing instead of free-will offerings, and also use raffles, bingo, bake sales, etc. to raise money. Instead of recognizing Christ as their mediator, many pray in the name of Mary or some other “saint.” Much of their teaching is not Scripturally oriented. They preach a message soothing to the ears.
<h4>Its Work</h4>
The work of the New Testament church was threefold: evangelism, edification and limited benevolence. (1) <b>Evangelism</b>. This is the primary duty of the church. It must preach the gospel to a lost and dying world (Matt. 28:18-20; Acts 8:4; 1 Tim. 3:15); (2) <b>Edification</b>. The church must help its members grow and develop spiritually (Eph. 4:11-16; Heb. 10:23-25; 1 Pet. 2:1-2); (3) <b>Benevolence</b>. The church must provide for needy saints in their time of affliction (Acts 4:34-35; 11:27-30; 1 Tim. 5:3-16).

However, churches of men often become engaged in works that God never authorized. Instead of carrying out its divine mission, many churches today have become involved in secular education, recreation and entertainment, general benevolence, business enterprises, and political activities. The saving gospel has been replaced by a “social gospel” in most modern churches.
<h4>Its Organization</h4>
Christ occupies a position of supreme authority over the church (Matt. 16:15-18; 28:18-20; Eph. 1:20-23). From a universal standpoint, each congregation is directly subject to Christ. The only functional unit of the church is the local congregation (1 Cor. 1:2; Phil. 1:1). Each is independent and autonomous (Acts 14:23).

Local congregations must be arranged after the Biblical pattern. Elders are to oversee and rule the flock (Acts 20:28; 1 Pet. 5:2-3). Deacons should minister to the physical needs of the members (Acts 6:1-6; Phil. 1:1). Evangelists proclaim the gospel of Christ (1 Tim. 4:6, 11-12; 2 Tim. 4:1-5). Members actively encourage one another and reach out to the lost (Heb. 5:12; 10:24-25).

However, churches of men have made drastic and unauthorized changes in the organization of the church. They ignore God’s plan for congregational autonomy by creating synods, councils, conventions, federations, and other forms of ecclesiastical hierarchies. Yet, one cannot read of arch-bishops, popes, or brotherhood elders in the New Testament.
<h4>Its Membership</h4>
The New Testament Church faithfully proclaimed God’s plan of redemption: Sinners must hear God’s Word (John 6:44-45; Rom. 10:17), believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God (John 8:24; Heb. 11:6), repent of their sins (Luke 13:3; Acts 17:30), confess their faith (Matt. 10:32; Rom. 10:9-10), and be baptized for the remission of sins (Mark 16:16; Acts 2:38; 22:16). Baptized believers are committed to a life of faithful service (1 Cor. 15:58; Rev. 2:10).

However, churches of men have changed God’s simple scheme of salvation. They reverse the order of these steps. Many say that repentance comes before faith. Those who practice infant baptism think that baptism comes before faith. Most denominations hold to the doctrine of faith only. They deny that baptism is essential to salvation. If they practice baptism at all, they change its purpose by saying that it is a sign that one has already been saved.
<h4>Its Discipline</h4>
The New Testament Church was submissive to divine discipline (2 Tim. 3:14-17; Heb. 12:5-11). Instructive discipline involves teaching and training that regulates character and conduct. Corrective discipline is reserved for those who rebel against God’s Word, serving to reprove and restore the sinner (1 Tim. 1:18-20). It also purifies and purges the church of evil (1 Cor. 5:7-13).

However, churches of men do not practice either instructive or corrective discipline. Instead of expounding the apostle’s doctrine, they titillate with trivialities. Instead of opposing sin, error and false doctrine, they fellowship the same.
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
The church we read of in the Bible has certain identifying characteristics. God’s Word sets forth its origin, names, rule of faith, work, worship, organization, and terms of membership. Any church today that conforms itself to this divine pattern is the church that the Lord will accept. It is right and cannot be wrong.

Some would argue, “It doesn’t matter what you believe or practice, so long as you are sincere.” Others say, “All roads lead to heaven.” However, this simply is not so (Matt. 7:21-23; Luke 6:46). Denominationalism, and all the division it brings, is contrary to the Bible’s plea for unity (John 17:20-21; 1 Cor. 1:10). Let us strive to pattern ourselves after the New Testament order (Matt. 28:18-20; Col. 3:17).
