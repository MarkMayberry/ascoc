Are you interested in finding a group of Christians who seek to worship God as He has directed in the Bible? Are you disenchanted with church services that emphasize the social and the secular instead of the spiritual and the sacred? If so, we invite you to regularly attend the services of the Lordâ€™s church that meets on Adoue Street. Come and hear plain Bible preaching. Worship God in spirit and in truth. Join with us as we seek to follow the Biblical pattern for the work, worship and organization of the church.
