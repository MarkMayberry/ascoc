<p class="wp-block-audio">Notes by Mark Mayberry from Ryan's Lesson</p>

<p>According to some studies, the average person makes 35,000 decisions over the course of a day.  Decisions that we make can impact the remainder of our lives and potentially determine where we will spend eternity.</p>

<p>Am I going to dedicate enough time to my spiritual growth (Acts 17:11)?</p>

<p>Will I choose friends who will build me up spiritually or those that tear me down (1 Cor. 15:33)?<br /><br />Will I choose a spouse who will help me spiritually and help me get to heaven, or will I choose someone who will be a detriment my children?</p>

<p>Will I watch that movie filled with language and sex, or will I choose a more wholesome form of entertainment (Phil 4:8)?<br /><br />Will I search for the narrow way that leads to heaven or take the broad and easy highway that leads to hell?<br /><br />Will I choose to serve God, or the idols of the surrounding pagan culture?<br /><br /></p>
