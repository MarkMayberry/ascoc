# A Simple Approach to Better Bible Study

By Bobby L. Graham

## Introduction

Much has been written concerning studying the Bible, and much has also been written concerning the Bible's worthiness of our study. Usually these two concerns have been addressed in separate books, but this book combines them and deals with them in one setting to demonstrate *Bible Study Done Right!*

Better Bible study can happen when one knows nothing about Hebrew or Greek, does not have an extensive library or the latest computer program, and has not attended college-level classes for Bible instruction. While these factors can be desirable and helpful, they are not essential.

What is essential is the desire, determination, and humility to seek God's will in Bible study! If you possess these three characteristics, then you have an advantage over those who do not have them, regardless of their tools for Bible study.

# Lesson 1: How Important Is It to Understand the Bible Better?

## Introduction

The Bible was given for man's benefit by its teaching, reproof, correction, and training in righteousness (2 Tim. 3:16-17).

> All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work (2 Tim. 3:16-17).

God Has revealed His will in the Bible so that it can be comprehended and obeyed by those who seek His will (John 8:32; Eph. 5:17).

> So Jesus was saying to those Jews who had believed Him, "If you continue in My word, then you are truly disciples of Mine; and you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free" (John 8:31-32)

> So then do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is (Eph. 5:17).

Rational beings can understand and apply the teaching of the Bible to their lives (Eph. 3:3-4; 2 Pet. 3:1-3).

> that by revelation there was made known to me the mystery, as I wrote before in brief. By referring to this, when you read, you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ (Eph. 3:3-4).

> This is now, beloved, the second letter I am writing to you in which I am stirring up your sincere mind by way of reminder, that you should remember the words spoken beforehand by the holy prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior spoken by your apostles. Know this first of all, that in the last days mockers will come with their mocking, following after their own lusts (2 Pet. 3:1-3).

Each word of the Bible is significant (Matt. 4:4), because the Lord used the Holy Spirit to reveal not only the ideas disclosed in the biblical account but also the words used to express them (1 Cor. 2:13).

> But He answered and said, "It is written, 'MAN SHALL NOT LIVE ON BREAD ALONE, BUT ON EVERY WORD THAT PROCEEDS OUT OF THE MOUTH OF GOD'" (Matt. 4:4).

> Yet we do speak wisdom among those who are mature; a wisdom, however, not of this age nor of the rulers of this age, who are passing away; but we speak God's wisdom in a mystery, the hidden wisdom which God predestined before the ages to our glory; the wisdom which none of the rulers of this age has understood; for if they had understood it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory; but just as it is written, "THINGS WHICH EYE HAS NOT SEEN AND EAR HAS NOT HEARD, AND which HAVE NOT ENTERED THE HEART OF MAN, ALL THAT GOD HAS PREPARED FOR THOSE WHO LOVE HIM." For to us God revealed them through the Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God. For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so the thoughts of God no one knows except the Spirit of God. **Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may know the things freely given to us by God, which things we also speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, combining spiritual thoughts with spiritual words** (1 Cor. 2:6-13, esp. vv. 12-13).

Jesus understood the verbal scope of divine inspiration, as did His apostles, because they sometimes based their arguments/reasonings on one word:

(a) "I am" is the present tense verb used by Jesus in Matthew 22:32 to prove His immortality/eternal nature sufficient for Him to still be the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, all still existing;

> But Jesus answered and said to them, "You are mistaken, not understanding the Scriptures nor the power of God. For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven. But regarding the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by God: 'I AM THE GOD OF ABRAHAM, AND THE GOD OF ISAAC, AND THE GOD OF JACOB'? He is not the God of the dead but of the living" (Matt. 22:29-32).

(b) In John 10:34, Jesus quoted the Hebrew in Psalms 82:6, using one word ("gods") as the basis of His argument in favor of the indestructibility of the Scriptures;

> The Jews picked up stones again to stone Him. Jesus answered them, "I showed you many good works from the Father; for which of them are you stoning Me?" The Jews answered Him, "For a good work we do not stone You, but for blasphemy; and because You, being a man, make Yourself out to be God." **Jesus answered them, "Has it not been written in your Law, 'I SAID, YOU ARE GODS'?** If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture cannot be broken), do you say of Him, whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, 'You are blaspheming,' because I said, 'I am the Son of God'? If I do not do the works of My Father, do not believe Me; but if I do them, though you do not believe Me, believe the works, so that you may know and understand that the Father is in Me, and I in the Father." Therefore, they were seeking again to seize Him, and He eluded their grasp (John 10:31-39, esp. v. 34).

> I said, "You are gods, and all of you are sons of the Most High (Ps. 82:6).

(c) Paul used the singular noun "Seed" to prove that Jesus Christ is Abraham's one descendant sent to bless the entire world, according to God's promise to Abraham (Gal. 3:16; cf. Acts 3:19-26, esp. v. 25; Gen. 12:3; 22:18; etc.).

> Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. He does not say, "And to seeds," as referring to many, but rather to one, "And to your seed," that is, Christ (Gal. 3:16).

> Therefore, repent and return, so that your sins may be wiped away, in order that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord; and that He may send Jesus, the Christ appointed for you, whom heaven must receive until the period of restoration of all things about which God spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets from ancient time. Moses said, "THE LORD GOD WILL RAISE UP FOR YOU A PROPHET LIKE ME FROM YOUR BRETHREN; TO HIM YOU SHALL GIVE HEED to everything He says to you. And it will be that every soul that does not heed that prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the people." And likewise, all the prophets who have spoken, from Samuel and his successors onward, also announced these days. **It is you who are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant which God made with your fathers, saying to Abraham, "AND IN YOUR SEED ALL THE FAMILIES OF THE EARTH SHALL BE BLESSED."** For you first, God raised up His Servant and sent Him to bless you by turning every one of you from your wicked ways (Acts 3:19-26, esp. v. 25).

> And I will bless those who bless you, and the one who curses you I will curse. And in you all the families of the earth will be blessed (Gen. 12:3).

> In your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, because you have obeyed My voice (Gen. 22:18).

Understanding the words of the Bible, in one sense of the word, is no different from understanding other kinds of information, because it requires learning the meaning of words in their ancient context (i.e., what did the words mean at that time?). This is possible regardless of the protestations of some.

In another sense, we must approach the Bible more seriously than we approach human writings. Can you explain why with the use of Bible passages?

## Conclusion

What have you learned in this introductory lesson that will guide the manner in which you approach Bible study?

How will these quotations guide you to Better Bible Study?

> Now these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of the mind, examining the Scriptures daily, whether these things were so. Many of them, therefore, believed. . . (Acts 17:11-12a).

Remember, an honest man alters his opinion to fit the truth, but a prejudiced man alters the truth to fit his opinion (unknown author; cf. Prov. 10:9; 24:26).

> He who walks in integrity walks securely, but he who perverts his ways will be found out (Prov. 10:9).

> He kisses the lips who gives a right answer (Prov. 24:26).

# Lesson 2: How Some Study the Bible

## Introduction

Attitude is the foremost reason for success in Bible study. How do you approach the study of Sacred Scripture? Which method described below best fits your Bible study?

## Improper and Undesirable Attitudes in Bible Study

Many study the Bible for the wrong reasons, which fall short of a desire to honor and obey God.

- **Academically:** as a literary product of human origin

- **Defensively:** to justify oneself

- **Ethically:** as a step toward achieving a more advanced degree of human evolution

- **Historically:** as mere history, without divine origin or purpose

- **Meditatively:** to reflect upon its precepts, but without realizing its divine authority

- **Philosophically:** to construct a system of human wisdom or philosophy, a way to approach life

## Proper and Desirable Attitudes in Bible Study

To achieve *Better Bible Study,* we need to manifest the right spirit. What attitudes should be reflected in the hearts and lives of true disciples?

- **Meekness:** willingness to receive instruction, correction, etc. (Jas. 1:21)

> Therefore, putting aside all filthiness and all that remains of wickedness, in humility receive the word implanted, which is able to save your souls (Jas. 1:21).

- **Godly fear:** trembling at God's word (Isa. 66:2)

> "For My hand made all these things, Thus all these things came into being," declares the LORD. "But to this one I will look, To him who is humble and contrite of spirit, and who trembles at My word (Isa. 66:2).

- **Reverently:** as word coming from God (1 Thess. 2:13)

> For this reason we also constantly thank God that when you received the word of God which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men, but for what it really is, the word of God, which also performs its work in you who believe (1 Thess. 2:13).

- **Confidently:** in faith, because it comes from God (1 Thes. 2:13)

> For this reason we also constantly thank God that when you received the word of God which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men, but for what it really is, the word of God, which also performs its work in you who believe (1 Thess. 2:13).

- **Consistently:** because we need to be fed and nourished daily (Acts 17:11)

> Now these were more noble-minded than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with great eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so (Acts 17:11).

- **Discerningly:** to prove what is true (Acts 17:11)

> Now these were more noble-minded than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with great eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so (Acts 17:11).

- **Eagerly:** having a readiness to learn (Acts 17:11)

> Now these were more noble-minded than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with great eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so (Acts 17:11).

- **Preventively:** to keep one safe from evil (Ps. 119:9-11)

> How can a young man keep his way pure? By keeping it according to Your word. With all my heart I have sought You; Do not let me wander from Your commandments. Your word I have treasured in my heart, that I may not sin against You (Ps. 119:9-11).

- **Purposefully:** to meet God's approval as an unashamed worker and handler of truth (2 Tim. 2:15)

> Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth (2 Tim. 2:15).

## Conclusion

As we have seen, many approach Sacred Scripture with the wrong attitude. They often assume the Bible to be of human origin, not divine, thereby hindering their attitude and approach to Bible study. Others study to justify their preconceived ideas.

In studying this lesson, did you see your own attitude toward previous Bible study?

How did it shape your reason for study and your approach to Better Bible Study?

# Lesson 3: Basic Rules for Better Bible Study

## Introduction

The rules presented in this lesson, though they express human thought, arise necessarily from the nature of the Bible as God's inspired word and from the reverence one should show toward God. Their validity will become apparent upon reading and considering them. The author believes they are required to be honest with God's Word.

## Simple vs. Basic/Fundamental

Contrast the concepts of "simple concepts," and "fundamental concepts."

The *Oxford English Dictionary* says the adjective "simple" refers to something that is (1) easily understood or done; presenting no difficulty, i.e., "a simple solution" (2) plain, basic, or uncomplicated in form, nature, or design."

In contrast, the adjective "fundamental" signifies "(1) forming a necessary base or core; of central importance, i.e. "interpretation of evidence is fundamental to the historian's craft"; (2) affecting or relating to the essential nature of something or the crucial point about an issue, i.e., "the fundamental problem remains that of the housing shortage."

Better Bible Study requires the same fundamental tools that are required to read and comprehend any text. Like an investigative reporter, we must ask (and answer) several basis questions: why, what, when, where, how, why, etc.

As one approaches the biblical text, it is important to understand who is speaking and who is being addressed. What is being discussed? When was the book written? Why is this story relevant? Does it apply to folks today, and if so, how?

Consider the main dispensations (plan, arrangement) and covenants (agreement legislated by God and accepted by people) presented throughout the Bible. It would be a travesty to take God's command for Noah to build an ark as His instruction to us today (Gen. 9:8-17). How does this passage indicate that God was not addressing us?

> Then God spoke to Noah and to his sons with him, saying, "Now behold, I Myself do establish My covenant with you, and with your descendants after you; and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the cattle, and every beast of the earth with you; of all that comes out of the ark, even every beast of the earth. "I establish My covenant with you; and all flesh shall never again be cut off by the water of the flood, neither shall there again be a flood to destroy the earth." God said, "This is the sign of the covenant which I am making between Me and you and every living creature that is with you, for all successive generations; I set My bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a sign of a covenant between Me and the earth. "It shall come about, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow will be seen in the cloud, and I will remember My covenant, which is between Me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and never again shall the water become a flood to destroy all flesh. "When the bow is in the cloud, then I will look upon it, to remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth." And God said to Noah, "This is the sign of the covenant which I have established between Me and all flesh that is on the earth" (Gen. 9:8-17).

Remember the make-up of the Bible. Old and New Testaments; Old Testament contents: five books of law, twelve books of history, five books of wisdom literature, seventeen books of prophecy (five major, twelve minor); New Testament contents: four books on the life of Christ, one book on the history of Church, twenty-one epistles/letters, one book of prophecy that foreshadows coming events that would soon transpire.

## Recognize the Three Dispensations

Be aware of the three main dispensations (plans) used by the Lord in His dealings with humanity: Patriarchal, Mosaic, Christian. How did God (a) communicate His will to people and (b) stipulate that sacrifices be offered under the three dispensations?

During the Patriarchal age, God spoke directly to the fathers (Gen. 6:13-14).

> Then God said to Noah, "The end of all flesh has come before Me; for the earth is filled with violence because of them; and behold, I am about to destroy them with the earth. Make for yourself an ark of gopher wood; you shall make the ark with rooms, and shall cover it inside and out with pitch" (Gen. 6:13-14).

During the Mosaic age, God spoke through Moses and the prophets (John 1:17; Luke 16:27-31; 24:44-49).

> For the Law was given through Moses; grace and truth were realized through Jesus Christ (John 1:17).

> And he said, 'Then I beg you, father, that you send him to my father's house— for I have five brothers—in order that he may warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.' "But Abraham said, 'They have Moses and the Prophets; let them hear them.' "But he said, 'No, father Abraham, but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent!' "But he said to him, 'If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be persuaded even if someone rises from the dead'" (Luke 16:27-31).

> Now He said to them, "These are My words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all things which are written about Me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled." Then He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures, and He said to them, "Thus it is written, that the Christ would suffer and rise again from the dead the third day, and that repentance for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in His name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem. You are witnesses of these things. And behold, I am sending forth the promise of My Father upon you; but you are to stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high" (Luke 24:44-49).

During the present Christian era, God speaks through His Son and the inspired apostles and prophets (Heb. 1:1-4; Eph. 3:1-5).

> God, after He spoke long ago to the fathers in the prophets in many portions and in many ways, in these last days has spoken to us in His Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, through whom also He made the world. And He is the radiance of His glory and the exact representation of His nature, and upholds all things by the word of His power. When He had made purification of sins, He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high, having become as much better than the angels, as He has inherited a more excellent name than they (Heb. 1:1-4).

> For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles— if indeed you have heard of the stewardship of God's grace which was given to me for you; that by revelation there was made known to me the mystery, as I wrote before in brief. By referring to this, when you read you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ, which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit (Eph. 3:1-5).

## Analyze the Text Itself

Determine the speaker (Gen. 3:4), audience (Acts 10:33), subject (Rom. 14:23), and circumstances of the statement (Rom. 16:16). How would doing this affect the relevance/application of the passage?

> The serpent said to the woman, "You surely will not die!" (Gen. 3:4).

> So I sent for you immediately, and you have been kind enough to come. Now then, we are all here present before God to hear all that you have been commanded by the Lord (Acts 10:33).

> But he who doubts is condemned if he eats, because his eating is not from faith; and whatever is not from faith is sin (Rom. 14:23).

> Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ greet you (Rom. 16:16).

Allow the Bible to explain itself where it does so. God knows best what He means!

(a) Sometimes the next verse best explains what the previous verse means (Gal. 3:16; 1 Thess. 4:16).

> Brethren, I speak in terms of human relations: even though it is only a man's covenant, yet when it has been ratified, no one sets it aside or adds conditions to it. **Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. He does not say, "And to seeds," as referring to many, but rather to one, "And to your seed," that is, Christ.** What I am saying is this: the Law, which came four hundred and thirty years later, does not invalidate a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to nullify the promise. For if the inheritance is based on law, it is no longer based on a promise; but God has granted it to Abraham by means of a promise. Why the Law then? It was added because of transgressions, having been ordained through angels by the agency of a mediator, until the seed would come to whom the promise had been made. Now a mediator is not for one party only; whereas God is only one. Is the Law then contrary to the promises of God? May it never be! For if a law had been given which was able to impart life, then righteousness would indeed have been based on law. But the Scripture has shut up everyone under sin, so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe. But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, being shut up to the faith which was later to be revealed. Therefore the Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ, so that we may be justified by faith. But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor. For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's descendants, heirs according to promise (Gal. 3:15-29).

> **But we do not want you to be uninformed, brethren, about those who are asleep**, so that you will not grieve as do the rest who have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with Him those who have fallen asleep in Jesus. For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have fallen asleep. For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we shall always be with the Lord. Therefore comfort one another with these words (1 Thess. 4:13-18).

(b) Let the Bible define its own terms when it does so (Rom. 6:4, "baptism" explained as a burial; 2 Cor. 6:14-16, "fellowship" used with synonyms).

> "Or do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death? Therefore we have been buried with Him through baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life (Rom. 6:3-4).

> "Do not be bound together with unbelievers; for what partnership have righteousness and lawlessness, or what fellowship has light with darkness? Or what harmony has Christ with Belial, or what has a believer in common with an unbeliever? Or what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For we are the temple of the living God; just as God said, "I WILL DWELL IN THEM AND WALK AMONG THEM; AND I WILL BE THEIR GOD, AND THEY SHALL BE MY PEOPLE" (2 Cor. 6:14-16).

(c) Make use of parallel verses if they are available, such as what it means to be filled with the Spirit (Eph. 5:18-19 and Col. 3:16), or understanding the Parable of the Sower/Soils (Matt. 13 and Luke 8).

> And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord (Eph. 5:18-19).

> Let the word of Christ richly dwell within you, with all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with thankfulness in your hearts to God (Col. 3:16).

(d) Consult other verses referring to the same matter (Acts 2:4; and also 1 Pet. 1:12; Gen. 4:4-5; Heb. 11:4).

> And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit was giving them utterance (Acts 2:4).

> It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves, but you, in these things which now have been announced to you through those who preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven—things into which angels long to look (1 Pet. 1:12).

> Abel, on his part also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of their fat portions. And the LORD had regard for Abel and for his offering; but for Cain and for his offering He had no regard. So Cain became very angry and his countenance fell."(Gen. 4:4-5).

> By faith Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain, through which he obtained the testimony that he was righteous, God testifying about his gifts, and through faith, though he is dead, he still speaks (Heb. 11:4).

## Avoid Creating Contradictions

Never attach a meaning which is incompatible with plain Bible teaching elsewhere found or contradictory to it.

(a) All the Bible is truth, and it is consistent with itself (Ps. 119:160; 2 Tim. 3:16).

> The sum of Your word is truth, and every one of Your righteous ordinances is everlasting (Ps. 119:160).

> All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness (2 Tim. 3:16).

(b) Example: In view of Ephesians 4:4, could Jesus have approved of denominationalism in His teaching on the Vine and the branches in John 15:5?

> There is one body and one Spirit, just as also you were called in one hope of your calling (Eph. 4:4).

> > I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing (John 15:5).

(c) What meaning does John 15:5 give to the branches?

> I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing (John 15:5).

(d) How do you know that Matthew 6:6 does not forbid public prayer?

> But you, when you pray, go into your inner room, close your door and pray to your Father who is in secret, and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you (Matt. 6:6).

> When they had been released, they went to their own companions and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them. And when they heard this, they lifted their voices to God with one accord and said, "O Lord, it is You who MADE THE HEAVEN AND THE EARTH AND THE SEA, AND ALL THAT IS IN THEM, who by the Holy Spirit, through the mouth of our father David Your servant, said, 'WHY DID THE GENTILES RAGE, AND THE PEOPLES DEVISE FUTILE THINGS? 'THE KINGS OF THE EARTH TOOK THEIR STAND, AND THE RULERS WERE GATHERED TOGETHER AGAINST THE LORD AND AGAINST HIS CHRIST.' For truly in this city there were gathered together against Your holy servant Jesus, whom You anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, to do whatever Your hand and Your purpose predestined to occur. And now, Lord, take note of their threats, and grant that Your bond-servants may speak Your word with all confidence, while You extend Your hand to heal, and signs and wonders take place through the name of Your holy servant Jesus." And when they had prayed, the place where they had gathered together was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak the word of God with boldness (Acts 4:23-31).

## Accept the Bible without Addition or Subtraction

Accept what the Bible teaches, but no more and no less (Deut. 4:2; 1 Cor. 4:6; Rev. 22:18-19).

> "You shall not add to the word which I am commanding you, nor take away from it, that you may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you (Deut. 4:2).

> Now these things, brethren, I have figuratively applied to myself and Apollos for your sakes, so that in us you may learn not to exceed what is written, so that no one of you will become arrogant in behalf of one against the other (1 Cor. 4:6).

> I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues which are written in this book; and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his part from the tree of life and from the holy city, which are written in this book (Rev. 22:18-19).

(a) Example: What does 1 Timothy 6:10 say is the root of all evil (cf. Col. 3:5)

> For the love of money is a root of all sorts of evil, and some by longing for it have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs (1 Tim. 6:10).

> Therefore consider the members of your earthly body as dead to immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and greed, which amounts to idolatry (Col. 3:5).

(b) Does 1 Corinthians 11:27 relate to one's being worthy or to the manner in which he eats the Supper (cf. vv. 27-32)?

> Therefore whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord. But a man must examine himself, and in so doing he is to eat of the bread and drink of the cup. For he who eats and drinks, eats and drinks judgment to himself if he does not judge the body rightly. For this reason many among you are weak and sick, and a number sleep. But if we judged ourselves rightly, we would not be judged. But when we are judged, we are disciplined by the Lord so that we will not be condemned along with the world (1 Cor. 11:27-32).

## Consider All Relevant Passages

Consider all passages on a subject before deriving a conclusion. Recognize that the Scriptures in their entirety are truth, and that divine revelation is consistent with itself (Ps. 119:160; 2 Tim. 3:16-17).

> The sum of Your word is truth, and every one of Your righteous ordinances is everlasting (Ps. 119:160).

> All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work (2 Tim. 3:16-17).

For example, what do all verses relating to music in New Testament worship instruct the Christian to do (Matt. 26:30; Mark 14:26; Acts 16:25; Rom. 15:9; 1 Cor. 14:15; Eph. 5:19; Col. 3:16; Heb. 2:12; 13:15; Jas. 5:13)?

> After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives (Matt. 26:30).

> After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives (Mark 14:26).

> But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns of praise to God, and the prisoners were listening to them (Acts 16:25).

> and for the Gentiles to glorify God for His mercy; as it is written, "THEREFORE I WILL GIVE PRAISE TO YOU AMONG THE GENTILES, AND I WILL SING TO YOUR NAME" (Rom. 15:9).

> What is the outcome then? I will pray with the spirit and I will pray with the mind also; I will sing with the spirit and I will sing with the mind also (1 Cor. 14:15).

> speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord (Eph. 5:19).

> Let the word of Christ richly dwell within you, with all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with thankfulness in your hearts to God (Col. 3:16).

> saying, "I WILL PROCLAIM YOUR NAME TO MY BRETHREN, IN THE MIDST OF THE CONGREGATION I WILL SING YOUR PRAISE" (Heb. 2:12).

> Through Him then, let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips that give thanks to His name (Heb. 13:15).

> Is anyone among you suffering? Then he must pray. Is anyone cheerful? He is to sing praises (Jas. 5:13).

(b) In view of Genesis 9:6 and Acts 25:11, why is it an abuse of Exodus 20:13 to teach that capital punishment is sinful? How is clarity achieved by also considering Paul's inspired statement in Romans 13:9?

> Whoever sheds man's blood, By man his blood shall be shed, For in the image of God He made man (Gen. 9:6).

> If, then, I am a wrongdoer and have committed anything worthy of death, I do not refuse to die; but if none of those things is true of which these men accuse me, no one can hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar (Acts 25:11).

## Understand Literature Properly

As in all literature, realize that biblical language is literal unless the context or the statement itself makes it impossible for it to be literal.

(a) Is Psalms 119:136 literal or figurative?

> My eyes shed streams of water, because they do not keep Your law (Ps. 119:136).

(b) Was Herod a four-legged fox (Luke 13:32)?

> And He said to them, "Go and tell that fox, 'Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I reach My goal.'" (Luke 13:32).

As in all literature, understand that the figurative language of the Bible is just as capable of conveying intended truth as the literal language. A later lesson will discuss figures of speech.

(a) What truth does Psalms 119:136 teach, though it is figurative?

(b) What about Luke 13:32?

## Conclusion

On one hand, in the rules set forth in this lesson, did you find even one which was arbitrarily set by men?

On the other hand, do you conclude they are necessary to assure honest conclusions in Better Bible Study?

# Lesson 4: The Nature of biblical Literature (Part 1)

## Introduction

Many think the Bible differs from other writings; thus, they do not study or understand it as they would other literature. They leave room for divine enlightenment to intervene to move them emotionally or to reveal to them Scripture's meaning.

It is different in source (God), nature (inspired Scriptures), scope (all humans intended), and purpose (salvation of the soul). Such differences should cause us to approach Bible study more carefully and seriously than we would the study of other writings.

On the other hand, the study of the Bible must employ the same approaches which other important documents would require to discern its meaning. This is true because the Bible consists of human language, the only kind available to God in making known His will for human understanding. God spoke to us in language, reflecting human ways of communication.

Let us, therefore, consider the various kind of statements in the Bible.

## Declarative Statements

The word "declaration" refers to "a formal or explicit statement or announcement" (Oxford). The Bible contains many declarative statements that tell us something, and present facts for us to believe/accept. Consider also John's declaration of God's great love for humanity (John 3:16).

> For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life (John 3:16).

Declarative statements often take the form of a command. In giving of the Great Commission, Jesus commanded the apostles to go and preach, and also stated consequences of accepting or rejecting the gospel message (Mark 16:15-16).

> And He said to them, "Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation. "He who has believed and has been baptized shall be saved; but he who has disbelieved shall be condemned" (Mark 16:15-16).

Sometimes declarative statements express God's desire (1 Tim. 2:3-4; 2 Pet. 3:9–10); how should such passages be interpreted?

> This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth (1 Tim. 2:3–4).

> The Lord is not slow about His promise, as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing for any to perish but for all to come to repentance. But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, in which the heavens will pass away with a roar and the elements will be destroyed with intense heat, and the earth and its works will be burned up (2 Pet. 3:9–10).

An entreaty differs slightly from an exhortation or a command---being more personal and affectionate, but no less authoratitive (2 Cor. 5:20; 6:1-2).

> Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were making an appeal through us; we beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God (2 Cor. 5:20).

> And working together with Him, we also urge you not to receive the grace of God in vain— for He says, "AT THE ACCEPTABLE TIME I LISTENED TO YOU, AND ON THE DAY OF SALVATION I HELPED YOU." Behold, now is "THE ACCEPTABLE TIME," behold, now is "THE DAY OF SALVATION" (2 Cor. 6:1–2).

## Conditional Statements

The term "conditional" refers to that which is "subject to one or more conditions or requirements being met; i.e., something made or granted on certain terms" (Oxford). Some conditional statements or promises have a divine condition attached to the statement (Mark 16:16; 2 Pet. 1:10).

> He who has believed and has been baptized shall be saved; but he who has disbelieved shall be condemned (Mark 16:16).

> Therefore, brethren, be all the more diligent to make certain about His calling and choosing you; for as long as you practice these things, you will never stumble (2 Pet. 1:10).

## Interrogative Statements

In grammar, the term "interrogative" signifies "having or conveying the force of a question" (Oxford). Interrogative statements ask a question, sometimes rhetorically, implying its own answer (1 Cor. 1:13). They are designed to provoke serious thought and teach important truths (Gal. 3:1-4).

> Has Christ been divided? Paul was not crucified for you, was he? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul? (1 Cor. 1:13).

> You foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified? This is the only thing I want to find out from you: did you receive the Spirit by the works of the Law, or by hearing with faith? Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh? Did you suffer so many things in vain—if indeed it was in vain? (Gal. 3:1-4).

## Imperative Statements

The term "imperative" is defined as "(1) of vital importance; crucial; (2) giving an authoritative command; peremptory." Imperative statements give commands that must be obeyed (Luke 10:25–28; 22:19-20; 1 Cor. 11:23–26). Doing the will of God is an imperative: "If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them" (John 13:17).

> And a lawyer stood up and put Him to the test, saying, "Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?" And He said to him, "What is written in the Law? How does it read to you?" And he answered, "YOU SHALL LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART, AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, AND WITH ALL YOUR STRENGTH, AND WITH ALL YOUR MIND; AND YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF." And He said to him, "You have answered correctly; **DO THIS** AND YOU WILL LIVE" (Luke 10:25–28).

> And when He had taken some bread and given thanks, He broke it and gave it to them, saying, "This is My body which is given for you; **do this** in remembrance of Me." And in the same way He took the cup after they had eaten, saying, "This cup which is poured out for you is the new covenant in My blood" (Luke 22:19-20).

> For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which He was betrayed took bread; and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, "This is My body, which is for you; **do this** in remembrance of Me." In the same way He took the cup also after supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in My blood; **do this**, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me." For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until He comes (1 Cor. 11:23–26).

> "If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them" (John 13:17) .

## Hortatory Statements

The term "hortatory" is defined as "tending or aiming to exhort" (Oxford). Hortatory statements give an exhortation to perform, and have the same significance as a command. Consider the "Let us" in Hebrews 4:1, 11, 14, 16, etc. where the author counts himself as one with the audience, affirming, "We are all in this together, so. Based on our shared accountability, "Let us. . ."

> Therefore, **let us** fear if, while a promise remains of entering His rest, any one of you may seem to have come short of it (Heb. 4:1).

> Therefore **let us** be diligent to enter that rest, so that no one will fall, through following the same example of disobedience (Heb. 4:11).

> Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, **let us** hold fast our confession (Heb. 4:14).

> Therefore **let us** draw near with confidence to the throne of grace, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need (Heb. 4:16).

## Conclusion

To practice recognizing and understanding these different type statements, take a few minutes to locate one or two of each kind in the Bible.

God wishes His people to be faithful and obedient. In training our children, sometimes we rebuke them, sometimes we command them, sometimes we encourage and exhort them. Our spiritual Father does the same. Paul showed the same disposition (1 Thess. 2:7-8).

> But we proved to be gentle among you, as a nursing mother tenderly cares for her own children. Having so fond an affection for you, we were well-pleased to impart to you not only the gospel of God but also our own lives, because you had become very dear to us (1 Thess. 2:7-8)

You can use the examples cited to guide you in finding others.

Make sure that you understand what each is saying and its purpose in the context.

# Lesson 5: The Nature of Biblical Literature (Part 2)

## Introduction

Besides direct statements (see Lesson 4), God also employs other means to teach us His will. Direct statements instruct by declaration, question, an expression of God's desire, entreaty, promise or condition, command, or exhortation. Now let us consider approved apostolic examples and necessary inferences.

Approved apostolic examples given for us to follow constitute a second means of establishing authority. They are accounts of action performed by apostles. Because they were given under inspiration of the Spirit, they are automatically approved, unless done in violation of divine law (such as Peter's hypocritical behavior that is recorded by Paul [Gal. 2:11-14], which serves as a negative example that saints must avoid). Accounts of action recorded by apostles to benefit others would also be automatically covered unless the context shows it to be sinful (such as the Corinthians' desecration of the Lord's Supper [1 Cor. 11:17-22]).

> But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned. For prior to the coming of certain men from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles; but when they came, he began to withdraw and hold himself aloof, fearing the party of the circumcision. The rest of the Jews joined him in hypocrisy, with the result that even Barnabas was carried away by their hypocrisy. But when I saw that they were not straightforward about the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas in the presence of all, "If you, being a Jew, live like the Gentiles and not like the Jews, how is it that you compel the Gentiles to live like Jews?" (Gal. 2:11-14).

> But in giving this instruction, I do not praise you, because you come together not for the better but for the worse. For, in the first place, when you come together as a church, I hear that divisions exist among you; and in part I believe it. For there must also be factions among you, so that those who are approved may become evident among you. Therefore when you meet together, it is not to eat the Lord's Supper, for in your eating each one takes his own supper first; and one is hungry and another is drunk. What! Do you not have houses in which to eat and drink? Or do you despise the church of God and shame those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? In this I will not praise you (1 Cor. 11:17-22).

Necessary implications, from which logically necessary inferences/conclusions can be drawn, are a third means of instruction. Consider the difference between an implication and an inference. The Oxford English Dictionary defines "implication" as "the conclusion that can be drawn from something although it is not explicitly stated," while an "inference" refers to "a conclusion reached on the basis of evidence and reasoning." An implication logically forces or produces a necessary inference or conclusion.

## Examples of Necessary Conclusions

## Philip and the Ethiopian Nobleman

Phillip the evangelist preached Jesus to the Ethiopian. Beginning in Isaiah 53, Phillip preached unto him Jesus. As they travelled along the road, they came to some water. The eunuch said, "Look! Water! What prevents me from being baptized?" Though unstated, Philip must have taught the treasurer the connection between Jesus's teaching in such passages as the Great Commission in Matthew 28:19-20 and the eunuch's need for baptism, in order for the Ethiopian to understand the need for baptism in Acts 8:36. His teaching *implied* the necessity of baptism, but the eunuch *inferred* his own need to be baptized. Through obedience to the gospel, he experienced "the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit" (Titus 3:5-7).

> But an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip saying, "Get up and go south to the road that descends from Jerusalem to Gaza." (This is a desert road.) So he got up and went; and there was an Ethiopian eunuch, a court official of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was in charge of all her treasure; and he had come to Jerusalem to worship, and he was returning and sitting in his chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah. Then the Spirit said to Philip, "Go up and join this chariot." Philip ran up and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said, "Do you understand what you are reading?" And he said, "Well, how could I, unless someone guides me?" And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him. Now the passage of Scripture which he was reading was this:

> HE WAS LED AS A SHEEP TO SLAUGHTER; AND AS A LAMB BEFORE ITS SHEARER IS SILENT, SO HE DOES NOT OPEN HIS MOUTH. "IN HUMILIATION HIS JUDGMENT WAS TAKEN AWAY; WHO WILL RELATE HIS GENERATION? FOR HIS LIFE IS REMOVED FROM THE EARTH.

> The eunuch answered Philip and said, "Please tell me, of whom does the prophet say this? Of himself or of someone else?" Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this Scripture he preached Jesus to him. As they went along the road they came to some water; and the eunuch *said, "Look! Water! What prevents me from being baptized?" And Philip said, "If you believe with all your heart, you may." And he answered and said, "I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God." And he ordered the chariot to stop; and they both went down into the water, Philip as well as the eunuch, and he baptized him. When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away; and the eunuch no longer saw him, but went on his way rejoicing (Acts 8:26-39).

> And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. "Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age" (Matt. 28:18-20).

> He saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we have done in righteousness, but according to His mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit, whom He poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that being justified by His grace we would be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life (Titus 3:5-7).

## Observing the Lord's Supper

A statement *necessarily* leading to a conclusion/inference would be of this kind. When Jesus commanded our observance of the Lord's supper in remembrance of Him (Luke 22:14-20), He necessarily implied that we must reflect upon the significance of the bread and the fruit of the vine, though He did not directly give such instruction. Paul's apostolic rebuke of the Corinthians' eating in 1 Corinthians 11 assumed this necessary implication and was based upon their responsibility to understand it (1 Cor. 11:23-32).

> When the hour had come, He reclined at the table, and the apostles with Him. And He said to them, "I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer; for I say to you, I shall never again eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God." And when He had taken a cup and given thanks, He said, "Take this and share it among yourselves; for I say to you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine from now on until the kingdom of God comes." And when He had taken some bread and given thanks, He broke it and gave it to them, saying, "This is My body which is given for you; do this in remembrance of Me." And in the same way He took the cup after they had eaten, saying, "This cup which is poured out for you is the new covenant in My blood" (Luke 22:14-20)

> For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which He was betrayed took bread; and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, "This is My body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of Me." In the same way He took the cup also after supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in My blood; do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me." For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until He comes.

> Therefore whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord. But a man must examine himself, and in so doing he is to eat of the bread and drink of the cup. For he who eats and drinks, eats and drinks judgment to himself if he does not judge the body rightly. For this reason many among you are weak and sick, and a number sleep. But if we judged ourselves rightly, we would not be judged. But when we are judged, we are disciplined by the Lord so that we will not be condemned along with the world (1 Cor. 11:23-32).

## Abraham's Journey to and from Egypt

Genesis 13:1 implies that Abraham and others in his family had already entered Egypt. Based on what it says, we can logically infer necessarily that he had gone down to Egypt without reading that he did so in Genesis 12:10.

> So Abram went up from Egypt to the Negev, he and his wife and all that belonged to him, and Lot with him (Gen. 13:1).

> Now there was a famine in the land; so Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was severe in the land (Gen. 12:10).

This same principle applies to the actual exodus (Exod. 4:21-23), and to similarity worded Messianic prophecy (Hosea 11:1; Matt. 2:13-15).

> And the LORD said to Moses, "When you go back to Egypt, see that you do all those wonders before Pharaoh which I have put in your hand. But I will harden his heart, so that he will not let the people go. Then you shall say to Pharaoh, 'Thus says the LORD: "Israel is My son, My firstborn. So I say to you, let My son go that he may serve Me. But if you refuse to let him go, indeed I will kill your son, your firstborn'" (Exod. 4:21-23).

> When Israel was a youth I loved him, and out of Egypt I called My son (Hosea 11:1).

> Now when they had gone, behold, an angel of the Lord *appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, "Get up! Take the Child and His mother and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you; for Herod is going to search for the Child to destroy Him." So Joseph got up and took the Child and His mother while it was still night, and left for Egypt. He remained there until the death of Herod. This was to fulfill what had been spoken by the Lord through the prophet: "OUT OF EGYPT I CALLED MY SON" (Matt. 2:13-15).

## Lessons from Hebrews

Consider use of necessary inference in the book of Hebrews, as it related to the subjects of Christ's priesthood (Heb. 7:11-14), and His sacrificial atonement, which ushered in the New Covenant (Heb. 9:16-22).

> Therefore, if perfection were through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the law), what further need was there that another priest should rise according to the order of Melchizedek, and not be called according to the order of Aaron? For the priesthood being changed, of necessity there is also a change of the law. For He of whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe, from which no man has officiated at the altar. For it is evident that our Lord arose from Judah, of which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood (Heb. 7:11-14).

> For where there is a testament, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator. For a testament is in force after men are dead, since it has no power at all while the testator lives. Therefore not even the first covenant was dedicated without blood. For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water, scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people, saying, "This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded you." Then likewise he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry. And according to the law almost all things are purified with blood, and without shedding of blood there is no remission (Heb. 9:16-22).

## Examples of Un-necessary Conclusions

A necessary inference/conclusion is impossible without a necessary implication. The inference that is drawn must be based on what the text first says and then implies. A necessary inference/conclusion is not just any conclusion, but one that is *inescapable* in view of the contextual evidence.

### The Example of Nicodemus

Why did Nicodemus come to Jesus by night (John 3:1-10, esp. v. 2)? Was it because of fear, or perhaps because he had been busy earlier in the day? The context does not say!

> There was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. This man came to Jesus by night and said to Him, "Rabbi, we know that You are a teacher come from God; for no one can do these signs that You do unless God is with him." Jesus answered and said to him, "Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God." Nicodemus said to Him, "How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born?" Jesus answered, "Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. "Do not marvel that I said to you, 'You must be born again.' "The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear the sound of it, but cannot tell where it comes from and where it goes. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit." Nicodemus answered and said to Him, "How can these things be?" Jesus answered and said to him, "Are you the teacher of Israel, and do not know these things? (John 3:1-10).

Later, the Pharisees and chief priest ordered Jesus's arrest (John 7:32), but were outraged when the officers returned empty-handed (John 7:45-49). Nicodemus courageously defended Jesus against the scornful accusations of the Sanhedrin, and found himself similarly derided (John 7:50-52).

> The Pharisees heard the crowd muttering these things about Him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to seize Him (John 7:32).

> Then the officers came to the chief priests and Pharisees, who said to them, "Why have you not brought Him?" The officers answered, "No man ever spoke like this Man!" Then the Pharisees answered them, "Are you also deceived? "Have any of the rulers or the Pharisees believed in Him? "But this crowd that does not know the law is accursed" (John 7:45-49).

> Nicodemus (he who came to Jesus by night, being one of them) said to them, "Does our law judge a man before it hears him and knows what he is doing?" They answered and said to him, "Are you also from Galilee? Search and look, for no prophet has arisen out of Galilee" (John 7:50-52).

After the crucifixion, Nicodemus joined with Josephus of Arimathea to give Jesus a proper burial (John 19:38-42). So, was Nicodemus a coward in John 3:1-2? Perhaps, the evidence is not so compelling as to demand this conclusion.

> After this, Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly, for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate gave him permission. So he came and took the body of Jesus. And Nicodemus, who at first came to Jesus by night, also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds. Then they took the body of Jesus, and bound it in strips of linen with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury. Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid. So there they laid Jesus, because of the Jews' Preparation Day, for the tomb was nearby (John 19:38-42).

### Fulfilling the Great Commission

The Great Commission is recorded in all four gospels and echoed in the book of Acts (Matt. 28:18-20; Mark 16:15-16; Luke 24:46-49; John 20:21-23; Acts 1:7-8). After Jesus told the apostles to go into all the world to preach, they might have concluded (a) He meant for them to go only by walking or (b) He meant for them to go to preach by whatever available means was available to them. The first conclusion (a) is an example of an inference unnecessarily drawn, but the latter (b) is a necessary inference/conclusion.

> And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age" (Matt. 28:18-20).

> And He said to them, "Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned" (Mark 16:15-16).

> Then He said to them, "Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day, and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. And you are witnesses of these things. Behold, I send the Promise of My Father upon you; but tarry in the city of Jerusalem until you are endued with power from on high" (Luke 24:46-49).

> So Jesus said to them again, "Peace to you! As the Father has sent Me, I also send you." And when He had said this, He breathed on them, and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained" (John 20:21-23).

> And He said to them, "It is not for you to know times or seasons which the Father has put in His own authority. But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth" (Acts 1:7-8).

## Conclusion

Find some examples of approved action in the New Testament.

Are all such examples binding upon believers?

Why or Why Not?

Also, look for some necessary inferences/conclusions.

Think of a conclusion drawn by some, though the conclusion is not necessary.

# Lesson 6: The Nature of Biblical Literature (Part 3)

## Introduction

All of these means used in divine revelation (as cited in Lesson 5) are equally authoritative. Passages are cited above to show that God embraced all of these means in making known His will. A careful reading of each passage sufficiently proves that the means Christ employed was authoritative because each was recorded with God's approval. Context establishes this point in each case.

No one means of divine revelation is stronger or weaker than any other. Men sometimes dismiss examples or necessary inferences, but God employed all of them with equal force. Never did He apologize for using any of them or indicate that more/less credence should be given to one method of establishing authority than to the others.

## Pondering a Familiar Parable

Jesus repeatedly taught truth by all three means, as did His apostles. Consider the parable of the Good Samaritan in Luke 10:25-37.

> And a lawyer stood up and put Him to the test, saying, "Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?" And He said to him, "What is written in the Law? How does it read to you?" And he answered, "YOU SHALL LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART, AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, AND WITH ALL YOUR STRENGTH, AND WITH ALL YOUR MIND; AND YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF." And He said to him, "You have answered correctly; DO THIS AND YOU WILL LIVE." But wishing to justify himself, he said to Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?"

> Jesus replied and said, "A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among robbers, and they stripped him and beat him, and went away leaving him half dead. "And by chance, a priest was going down on that road, and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side. "Likewise, a Levite also, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. "But a Samaritan, who was on a journey, came upon him; and when he saw him, he felt compassion, and came to him and bandaged up his wounds, pouring oil and wine on them; and he put him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn and took care of him. "On the next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper and said, 'Take care of him; and whatever more you spend, when I return I will repay you.' "Which of these three do you think proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell into the robbers' hands?"

> And he said, "The one who showed mercy toward him." Then Jesus said to him, "Go and do the same" (Luke 10:25-37).

1. In verse 25, the lawyer ask Jesus a question. In verse 26, Jesus responded with a *question* (i.e., an interrogative)---designed to provoke deeper thought and introspection.

2. In verses 27-28, Jesus acknowledged the lawyer accurately quoted from the Law of Moses which was currently in force. In other words, He offered a *declarative statement* of truth.

3. Unfortunately, the lawyer sought to evade Jesus's teaching in verse 29.

4. In response, the Lord provided a parable, i.e., an *example,* of a neighbor helping another in verses 30-35.

5. Jesus asked a question in verse 36 designed to *force a conclusion,* i.e., help the lawyer draw a *necessary inference.*

6. In verse 37, He then gave a *command* (i.e., an imperative) based upon an example and a necessary inference.

7. If examples and necessary inferences are invalid/not binding, as some claim, then this command based upon them is equally invalid.

## Conclusion

We have learned that every word coming from God is significant (Matt. 4:1-11; 2 Tim. 3:14-17). From the first reference, explain how Jesus overcame Satan's enticements by appealing to God's revealed word, as expressed in familiar and less well-known texts. From the second reference, explain the benefits that the study of Sacred Scripture bestowed upon Timothy.

> Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. And after He had fasted forty days and forty nights, He then became hungry. And the tempter came and said to Him, "If You are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread." But He answered and said, "It is written, 'MAN SHALL NOT LIVE ON BREAD ALONE, BUT ON EVERY WORD THAT PROCEEDS OUT OF THE MOUTH OF GOD.'" Then the devil *took Him into the holy city and had Him stand on the pinnacle of the temple, and *said to Him, "If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down; for it is written, 'HE WILL COMMAND HIS ANGELS CONCERNING YOU'; and 'ON their HANDS THEY WILL BEAR YOU UP, SO THAT YOU WILL NOT STRIKE YOUR FOOT AGAINST A STONE.'" Jesus said to him, "On the other hand, it is written, 'YOU SHALL NOT PUT THE LORD YOUR GOD TO THE TEST.'" Again, the devil *took Him to a very high mountain and *showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory; and he said to Him, "All these things I will give You, if You fall down and worship me." Then Jesus *said to him, "Go, Satan! For it is written, 'YOU SHALL WORSHIP THE LORD YOUR GOD, AND SERVE HIM ONLY.'" Then the devil *left Him; and behold, angels came and began to minister to Him (Matt. 4:1-11).

> You, however, continue in the things you have learned and become convinced of, knowing from whom you have learned them, and that from childhood you have known the sacred writings which are able to give you the wisdom that leads to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work (2 Tim. 3:14-17).

In this lesson, we have seen various kinds of statements are used by God to express truth. What are they?

We also have seen the three means/methods employed in the Bible to teach God's will. What are they?

In communicating with the lawyer in Luke 10:25-37, Jesus clearly demonstrates how man's duty to God is manifested. In your own words, show how the Lord employed different approaches/methods in teaching the lawyer what was appropriate and authoritative.

Please apply the same careful analysis to Luke's record of Philip's teaching the Ethiopian treasurer in Acts 8:30-38.

# Lesson 7: Literal and Figurative Language (Part 1)

## Introduction

All languages, including the language used in the Scriptures, are literal or figurative. Because humans use both kinds in their daily communication, God saw fit to use both in His communication to the world to facilitate understanding.

To classify language as figurative in no way lessens its value or truthfulness. Likewise, to classify language as literal does not mean that it is any truer or more valuable than figurative language. Different kinds of figurative language serve different purposes, each being equally valuable and true.

## The Nature of Literal Language

Literal language is the kind of language spoken by people most of the time, even in the Bible. It is more direct than figurative language, because it means exactly what it says (Acts 17:30-31; Mark 6:41-44). The words used retain their usual/dictionary/lexicon definitions (Acts 2:38; 1 Cor. 5:1-2). This kind of language is used for straightforward narration of events, instruction concerning spiritual matters, giving of divine law, and other purposes requiring specific and clear statement. Can you find an example of each function mentioned in the preceding sentence in the Bible?

> Therefore having overlooked the times of ignorance, God is now declaring to men that all people everywhere should repent, because He has fixed a day in which He will judge the world in righteousness through a Man whom He has appointed, having furnished proof to all men by raising Him from the dead (Acts 17:30-31).

> And He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up toward heaven, He blessed the food and broke the loaves and He kept giving them to the disciples to set before them; and He divided up the two fish among them all. They all ate and were satisfied, and they picked up twelve full baskets of the broken pieces, and also of the fish. There were five thousand men who ate the loaves (Mark 6:41-44).

> Peter said to them, "Repent, and each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit" (Acts 2:38).

> It is actually reported that there is immorality among you, and immorality of such a kind as does not exist even among the Gentiles, that someone has his father's wife. You have become arrogant and have not mourned instead, so that the one who had done this deed would be removed from your midst (1 Cor. 5:1-2).

## The Nature of Figurative Language

On the other hand, figurative language is spoken and written less frequently in the Bible, but it is still true and powerful. While a word's literal meaning always comes first in the word's history, the figurative meaning develops by use in the language and by extension to new situations (examples: baptize, word, house, cup). A figurative statement is more indirect than a literal statement, because it employs meanings besides the obvious basic ones found in the dictionary/lexicon (Matt. 3:7-8; 23:1-2; Luke 13:32).

> But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism, he said to them, "You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? "Therefore bear fruit in keeping with repentance (Matt. 3:7-8).

> Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to His disciples, saying: "The scribes and the Pharisees have seated themselves in the chair of Moses (Matt. 23:1-2).

> And He said to them, "Go and tell that fox, 'Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I reach My goal'" (Luke 13:32).

Because words change their meanings according to use, words used in the Bible also through time and use change their meanings from the basic definitions. It is imperative to learn the meaning the word had when it was used in the Scriptures because of the tendency of word usage to alter meanings of words.

Modern examples of altered meanings (dial the number, lasso the child, channel surfing, all hands on deck), etc. biblical words with altered meanings in modern usage (church, baptism, baptize, Christian, supper, elder, bishop, deacon). Be ready to discuss these words' changes from their biblical meanings.

## Conclusion

Explain the difference between literal and figurative language.

Think of examples of each kind of language you have recently heard, read, or spoken.

When do you think figurative language serves a good purpose in your own communication?

When would you try to avoid it?

# Lesson 8: Literal and Figurative Language (Part 2)

## Introduction

All languages---ancient and modern, biblical and non-biblical---use both literal and figurative expressions, because each has advantages. It should not surprise us that we find figures of speech in the Bible, just as they are common in everyday life and all forms of literature. They serve a good purpose.

## The Fundamental Purpose of Literal and Figurative Language

Skeptics and unbelievers sometimes charge that the Bible is "just figurative" because it uses figures of speech. This charge is untrue for reasons already studied. If the presence of figurative language makes a document totally figurative and, therefore, unreliable, then we would have to treat everyday speech in the same way, because it also employs figures of speech.

While there are large sections of the Bible which include the figurative in large supply (Psalms, Proverbs, and shorter sections of many biblical books), its use does not render them unreliable. To believe such is to misunderstand the function of the two kinds of language.

While figurative language usually dominates historical narrative and spiritual instruction/law, even these sometimes employ brief figures of speech to express ideas more concisely or more strongly. Larger sections of Old Testament poetic literature are figurative for these stated reasons (Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon). Using these Old Testament books, try to locate figures of speech which express the thought more briefly or meaningfully than literal expression would.

## Conclusion

Remember, the Bible's figurative language does not render God's book unreliable or less reliable.

Does your use of figures of speech mean your speech is untrue or unreliable?

Find some longer sections of the Bible using figurative language (such as Paul's allegory of Hagar and Sarah [Gal. 4:21-31] and also examples from Psalms and Proverbs), and also explain the meaning.

> Tell me, you who want to be under law, do you not listen to the law? For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the bondwoman and one by the free woman. But the son by the bondwoman was born according to the flesh, and the son by the free woman through the promise. This is allegorically speaking, for these women are two covenants: one proceeding from Mount Sinai bearing children who are to be slaves; she is Hagar. Now this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children. But the Jerusalem above is free; she is our mother. For it is written, "REJOICE, BARREN WOMAN WHO DOES NOT BEAR; BREAK FORTH AND SHOUT, YOU WHO ARE NOT IN LABOR; FOR MORE NUMEROUS ARE THE CHILDREN OF THE DESOLATE THAN OF THE ONE WHO HAS A HUSBAND." And you brethren, like Isaac, are children of promise. But as at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so it is now also. But what does the Scripture say? "CAST OUT THE BONDWOMAN AND HER SON, FOR THE SON OF THE BONDWOMAN SHALL NOT BE AN HEIR WITH THE SON OF THE FREE WOMAN." So then, brethren, we are not children of a bondwoman, but of the free woman (Gal. 4:21-31).

We should be aware of the kind of literature being studied so we can be alert to the presence of figures of speech and understand them properly. The primary rule is to remember that we should strive to understand biblical language just as we try to understand everyday speech, considering the writer's intention, meaning, and application. We do not have the right to impose our meaning, preference, or inference on what the Bible says!

# Lesson 9: Figures of Speech Used in the Bible (Part 1)

## Introduction

The same figures of speech occurring in everyday speech and writing also appear in the Bible. The Holy Spirit obviously used such to accommodate the word of God to human expression, so that each person might understand the Lord's will in his own language and live by it (John 8:32; Eph. 3:3-4; 5:17; 2 Pet. 3:1-3).

## Some Common Figures of Speech in the Bible (Part 1)

**Simile:** indirect comparison signaled by "like" or "as" (Psa. 1:3)

> A simile is a figure of speech that directly compares two things. Similes differ from other metaphors by highlighting the similarities between two things using comparison words such as "like", "as", "so", or "than", while other metaphors create an implicit comparison (i.e. saying something "is" something else) (Wikipedia).

**Metaphor:** direct comparison indicating one thing to be/to represent another thing (John 8:12; 2 Cor. 12:7)

**Allegory:** series of metaphors representing something else (Gal. 4:21-31)

> An allegory is a story, poem, or picture that can be interpreted to reveal a hidden meaning, typically a moral or political one (Oxford Dictionary).

**Apostrophe:** addressing an imaginary/unpresent audience (2 Sam. 18:33; Jer. 47:6-7; 1 Cor. 15:55, also personification used here.

> In grammar, an apostrophe is a punctuation mark ( ' ) used to indicate either possession (e.g., Harry's book; boys' coats) or the omission of letters or numbers (e.g., can't; he's; class of '99). In rhetoric, it refers to an exclamatory passage in a speech or poem addressed to a person (typically one who is dead or absent) or thing (Oxford).

**Ellipsis:** omission of words understood as necessary (1 Cor. 1:17, "not only")

> In grammar, an ellipsis identifies the omission from speech or writing of a word or words that are superfluous or able to be understood from contextual clues (Oxford).

**Hyperbole:** exaggeration meant for effect (Num. 13:33; Psa. 6:6-7; Eph. 3:8)

> In grammar, a hyperbole refers to an exaggerated statement or claims not meant to be taken literally (Oxford).

**Irony:** saying one thing but meaning another, especially the opposite (1 Kings 18:27; Job12:2)

> In grammar, irony is the expression of one's meaning by using language that normally signifies the opposite, typically for humorous or emphatic effect (Oxford).

**Metonymy:** change of name from one thing to another, with both names being the same thing (Luke 16:29, 31---Moses and the prophets; Acts 7:51---Holy Spirit; 1 Cor. 11:25-27---cup)

> In grammar, metonymy refers to the substitution of the name of an attribute or adjunct for that of the thing meant, for example, suit for business executive, or the track for horse racing (Oxford).

**Parable:** placing a spiritual lesson beside a physical event to stress an idea (Luke 8:4-18)

> In literature, a parable is a simple story used to illustrate a moral or spiritual lesson, as told by Jesus in the Gospels (Oxford).

**Personification:** treating an object or idea as a person (Luke 13:34-35)

> In literature, personification is the attribution of a personal nature or human characteristics to something nonhuman, or the representation of an abstract quality in human form (Oxford).

**Prolepsis:** changing chronology/stating what is to be as current (Gen. 3:20; 12:8; cf. 28:19)

> In argumentation and debate, prolepsis is the anticipation and answering of possible objections in rhetorical speech (Oxford).

**Rhetoric:** the representation of a thing as existing before it actually does or did so, as in he was a dead man when he entered.

> Rhetoric is the art of effective or persuasive speaking or writing, especially the use of figures of speech and other compositional techniques (Oxford).

**Proverb:** short, pithy truism that is complete within itself but not exhaustive (Prov. 3:8; 22:6)

> A proverb is a short pithy saying in general use, stating a general truth or piece of advice (Oxford).

**Sarcasm:** speaking with satire or irony (Matt. 27:29; Mark 15:31-32)

> Sarcasm is the use of irony to mock or convey contempt (Oxford).

**Synecdoche:** putting one word for an associated word, as (1) the part for the whole or vice versa (Matt. 6:11; 13:24, 31; Rom. 16:4); (2) container for contents or vice versa (John 3:16; 1 Cor. 10:16; 11:26); (3) singular for the plural or vice versa (Gen. 8:4; Ex. 15:1).

> Synecdoche is a figure of speech in which a part is made to represent the whole or vice versa, as in Cleveland won by six runs (meaning "Cleveland's baseball team").

## Conclusion

Can you find some other biblical examples of the figures of speech named above?

Based on your Bible study, which figures of speech do you think are used more frequently?

# Lesson 10: Figures of Speech Used in the Bible (Part 2)

## Introduction

Knowing what the distinct figures of speech are called is good, but we must also know how to find them to understand what they mean in their context. In this lesson, we shall pay attention to learning how to detect them.

## Detecting Figures of Speech

First, gain a sense of the context by reading through its few times. An excellent exercise is to read Colossians 2:9-17 to learn what the writer is talking about in the context. What was nailed to the cross in Colossians 2:14? Was it sins or the Old Covenant/Law? In view of the clear references to old covenant ordinances and their significance in verses 16-17, it becomes clear that he speaks of the Law's being annulled, not to sins' being done away at the cross. Though the latter is true, it is not the point in this particular context.

> For in Him all the fullness of Deity dwells in bodily form, and in Him you have been made complete, and He is the head over all rule and authority; and in Him you were also circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, in the removal of the body of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ; having been buried with Him in baptism, in which you were also raised up with Him through faith in the working of God, who raised Him from the dead. When you were dead in your transgressions and the uncircumcision of your flesh, He made you alive together with Him, having forgiven us all our transgressions, having canceled out the certificate of debt consisting of decrees against us, which was hostile to us; and He has taken it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross. When He had disarmed the rulers and authorities, He made a public display of them, having triumphed over them through Him. Therefore no one is to act as your judge in regard to food or drink or in respect to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath day— things which are a mere shadow of what is to come; but the substance belongs to Christ (Col. 2:9-17).

Accept it as figurative if the literal meaning is impossible (Ps. 119:136; Matt. 8:22). Rivers/streams of water would not literally gush from one's eyes, nor could dead people literally bury the dead. The meaning in each verse must be figurative.

> Rivers of water run down from my eyes, because men do not keep Your law (Ps. 119:136, NKJV).

> My eyes shed streams of water, because they do not keep Your law (Ps. 119:136, NASB).

> But Jesus *said to him, "Follow Me, and allow the dead to bury their own dead" (Matt. 8:22).

Take it as figurative if the literal meaning causes a contradiction with another passage (John 11:25-26). Because all are under the sentence of death (Eccl. 3:20; Heb. 9:27-28), and since it is impossible for the same person to both live and die literally, the figurative (spiritual) meaning must be intended.

> Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in Me will live even if he dies, and everyone who lives and believes in Me will never die. Do you believe this?" (John 11:25-26).

> All go to the same place. All came from the dust and all return to the dust (Eccl. 3:20).

> And inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once and after this comes judgment, so Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time for salvation without reference to sin, to those who eagerly await Him (Heb. 9:27-28).

If evil is commended or if good is forbidden, the meaning must be figurative (Luke 14:26). The nature and character of God would forbid literal hating of these persons in the verses; He intends a comparative/relative meaning, to love family less than Him, or Him more than family, as stated in Matthew 10:37.

> Now large crowds were going along with Him; and He turned and said to them, "If anyone comes to Me, and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be My disciple" (Luke 14:25-26).

> We love, because He first loved us. If someone says, "I love God," and hates his brother, he is a liar; for the one who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen. And this commandment we have from Him, that the one who loves God should love his brother also (1 John 4:19-21).

> He who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me; and he who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me (Matt. 10:37).

When it is stated that the statement is figurative, take it as figurative. The allegory of Hagar and Sarah in Galatians 4:21-31 contains such a statement in verse 24.

> This is allegorically speaking, for these women are two covenants: one proceeding from Mount Sinai bearing children who are to be slaves; she is Hagar (Gal. 4:24).

In Jesus's teaching of John 2:19-21, He makes it clear that He spoke figuratively in verse 21. However, this did not keep the Sanhedrin from twisting His words as they sought justification for putting Him to death (Mark 14:55-59).

> Jesus answered them, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up." The Jews then said, "It took forty-six years to build this temple, and will You raise it up in three days?" But He was speaking of the temple of His body (John 2:19-21).

> Now the chief priests and the whole council kept trying to obtain testimony against Jesus to put Him to death, and they were not finding any. For many were giving false testimony against Him, but their testimony was not consistent. Some stood up and began to give false testimony against Him, saying, "We heard Him say, 'I will destroy this temple made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands.'" Not even in this respect was their testimony consistent (Mark 14:55-59).

If a definite word is put for an indefinite one, the meaning is figurative. Consider the symbolic use of numbers, such as "ten days" (Rev. 2:10) and "a thousand years" (Rev. 20:1-3). The former refers to a relatively short period of persecution and the latter refers to a long period in which the influence of evil is limited by the spread of the gospel.

> Do not fear what you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to cast some of you into prison, so that you will be tested, and you will have tribulation for ten days. Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life (Rev. 2:10).

> Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold of the dragon, the serpent of old, who is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years; and he threw him into the abyss, and shut it and sealed it over him, so that he would not deceive the nations any longer, until the thousand years were completed; after these things he must be released for a short time (Rev. 20:1-3).

Contrast Peter's use of 1,000 in 2 Peter 3:8 and John's use of ten days in Revelation 2:10. Peter demands the figurative meaning in verse 8, not an equivalence of so many days for so many years. As previously noted, John also uses the definite "ten days" for a short, indeterminate period.

> But by His word the present heavens and earth are being reserved for fire, kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.

But do not let this one fact escape your notice, beloved, that with the Lord one day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years like one day. The Lord is not slow about His promise, as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing for any to perish but for all to come to repentance (2 Pet. 3:7-9).

Numeric comparisons are also found in the Old Testament. Psalm 50 declares, "For every beast of the forest is Mine, the cattle on a thousand hills" (v. 10). Does this mean that God has no claim on the cattle that might occupy hill number 1001? Don't be foolish! The next verse states, "Everything that moves in the field is Mine" (v. 11).

As Solomon reflected upon the futility of life, he contrasted miscarriage with one who lives a long life (Eccl. 6:3-6).

> For every beast of the forest is Mine, the cattle on a thousand hills. I know every bird of the mountains, and everything that moves in the field is Mine (Ps. 50:10-11).

> If a man fathers a hundred children and lives many years, however many they be, but his soul is not satisfied with good things and he does not even have a proper burial, then I say, "Better the miscarriage than he, for it comes in futility and goes into obscurity; and its name is covered in obscurity. It never sees the sun and it never knows anything; it is better off than he. Even if the other man lives a thousand years twice and does not enjoy good things—do not all go to one place? (Eccl. 6:3-6).

When a statement is made in mockery/sarcasm, it is figurative. Elijah's statement that Baal was on a journey or sleeping in 1 Kings 18:27 is this kind of figure of speech. The enemies of the Lord spoke in derision, not of their true faith in Luke 23:35.

> So Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, "Choose one ox for yourselves and prepare it first for you are many, and call on the name of your god, but put no fire under it. " Then they took the ox which was given them and they prepared it and called on the name of Baal from morning until noon saying, "O Baal, answer us." But there was no voice and no one answered. And they leaped about the altar which they made. It came about at noon that Elijah mocked them and said, "Call out with a loud voice, for he is a god; either he is occupied or gone aside, or is on a journey, or perhaps he is asleep and needs to be awakened." So they cried with a loud voice and cut themselves according to their custom with swords and lances until the blood gushed out on them. When midday was past, they raved until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice; but there was no voice, no one answered, and no one paid attention (1 Kings 18:25-29).

> And the people stood by, looking on. And even the rulers were sneering at Him, saying, "He saved others; let Him save Himself if this is the Christ of God, His Chosen One." The soldiers also mocked Him, coming up to Him, offering Him sour wine, and saying, "If You are the King of the Jews, save Yourself!" Now there was also an inscription above Him, "THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS" (Luke 23:35-38)

You should use common sense (what you already know from life and the Bible) to see the statement as figurative. An example where you should use common sense occurs in Deuteronomy 32:41-42, where "arrows drunk with blood" appears. Another example appears in 1 Corinthians 3:2, which says that Christians at Corinth had been feeding on "milk," not "solid food." More biblical teaching about such spiritual food is found in Hebrews 5:12-14.

> If I sharpen My flashing sword, And My hand takes hold on justice, I will render vengeance on My adversaries, And I will repay those who hate Me. I will make My arrows drunk with blood, And My sword will devour flesh, With the blood of the slain and the captives, From the long-haired leaders of the enemy (Deut. 32:41-42).

> And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to men of flesh, as to infants in Christ. I gave you milk to drink, not solid food; for you were not yet able to receive it. Indeed, even now you are not yet able, for you are still fleshly. For since there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly, and are you not walking like mere men? For when one says, "I am of Paul," and another, "I am of Apollos," are you not mere men? (1 Cor. 3:1-4).

> For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you have need again for someone to teach you the elementary principles of the oracles of God, and you have come to need milk and not solid food. For everyone who partakes only of milk is not accustomed to the word of righteousness, for he is an infant. But solid food is for the mature, who because of practice have their senses trained to discern good and evil (Heb. 5:12-14).

## Conclusion

In *Better Bible Study,* look for passages where you believe figurative language is found, based on the clues given in this lesson.

Is such language more prevalent in certain parts of the Bible than in others?

# Lesson 11: Is the New Testament a Mere Collection of Love Letters?

## Introduction

Some have alleged that the books of the New Testament are like "love letters," having no binding force of law but only the expression of God's love for His people. If they contain any mandates from God, distinguishing such from the "love" part is so difficult that they have not given us their method for so doing. Paul's correction of the abuse of the Lord's Supper at Corinth was not God's mandate, simply a subtle plea for them to do better; Peter's instruction concerning diligent Christian growth in the graces mentioned in 2 Peter 1 was not a command, but his loving request for them to grow in whatever ways they found convenient; and John's urgent rebuke of the saints in Ephesus to repent and return to their first love in Revelation 2:4-5 was not meant as an authoritative message, only as God's show of fervent love for them. To take it as a mandate or divine law would require the acceptance of examples and necessary inferences as binding. How does this idea fit with various NT passages and principles?

## New Testament Scriptures: Divine Law, Not Just Love Letters/Narrative

In Better Bible Study, we notice that certain things are stressed. Patterns are stressed as ways to do things. There is the idea that God wants us to conform to His ways. Would this be true of the Love-letter or Law approach? The following points make this point clear:

We must follow the doctrinal pattern revealed in the gospel (Rom. 6:17-18; Phil. 3:17-19). The Greek word *tupos,* translated "form" or "pattern," refers to "a visual form designed to be imitated or copied—'model, pattern' (Louw and Nida, 591).

> But thanks be to God that though you were slaves of sin, you became obedient from the heart to that **form** (Greek: *tupos*) of teaching to which you were committed, and having been freed from sin, you became slaves of righteousness (Rom. 6:17-18).

> Brethren, join in following my example, and observe those who walk according to the **pattern** (Greek: *tupos*) you have in us. For many walk, of whom I often told you, and now tell you even weeping, that they are enemies of the cross of Christ, whose end is destruction, whose god is their appetite, and whose glory is in their shame, who set their minds on earthly things (Phil. 3:17-19).

We must not teach strange/different doctrines (1 Tim. 1:3-4). The Greek word *heterodidaskaleō,* identifies "to teach contrary to standard instruction, give divergent, i.e. divisive, instruction" (BDAG, 399).

> As I urged you upon my departure for Macedonia, remain on at Ephesus so that you may instruct certain men not to teach **strange doctrines** (Greek: *heterodidaskaleō*), nor to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which give rise to mere speculation rather than furthering the administration of God which is by faith (1 Tim. 1:3-4).

Those who teach a contrary message are condemned in the strongest terms (Rom. 16:17-18).

> Now I urge you, brethren, keep your eye on those who cause dissensions and hindrances contrary to the teaching which you learned, and turn away from them. For such men are slaves, not of our Lord Christ but of their own appetites; and by their smooth and flattering speech, they deceive the hearts of the unsuspecting (Rom. 16:17-18).

We must speak *sound words* (1 Tim. 6:3-4; 2 Tim. 1:13-14). The Greek word *hugiainō,* translated "sound," means "to be sound, healthy" (Thomas, 5198). The English "hygiene" can be traced back to this term. Note also that *sound words* are identified as a *standard* (Greek: *hupotupōsis*), i.e., "a model, a basis for behavioral comparison, standard, pattern" (BDAG, 1042).

> If anyone advocates a different doctrine and does not agree with **sound words,** those of our Lord Jesus Christ, and with the doctrine conforming to godliness, he is conceited and understands nothing; but he has a morbid interest in controversial questions and disputes about words, out of which arise envy, strife, abusive language, evil suspicions (1 Tim. 6:3-4).

> Retain the standard of **sound words** which you have heard from me, in the faith and love which are in Christ Jesus. Guard, through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us, the treasure which has been entrusted to you (2 Tim. 1:13-14).

Jesus Christ left us an example that we should follow in His steps (1 Pet. 2:21). The Greek word *hupogrammos,* translated "example," refers to "(to trace in outline, sketch out); from hupo (under) and graphō (writing), i.e., a writing to be copied" (Thomas, 5261).

> For you have been called for this purpose, since Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an **example** for you to follow in His steps (1 Pet. 2:21).

The Law of Moses was a shadow and copy of the heavenly things, indicating that the original is more important than copy (Heb. 8:5; 9:23). The Greek word *hupodeigma,* translated "copy," refers to "a figure, copy, example" (Thomas, 5262).

> Now if He were on earth, He would not be a priest at all, since there are those who offer the gifts according to the Law; who serve a **copy** and shadow of the heavenly things, just as Moses was warned by God when he was about to erect the tabernacle; for, "SEE," He says, "THAT YOU MAKE all things ACCORDING TO THE PATTERN WHICH WAS SHOWN YOU ON THE MOUNTAIN" (Heb. 8:4-5).

> Therefore, it was necessary for the **copies** of the things in the heavens to be cleansed with these, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these (Heb. 9:23).

We must imitate Jesus Christ and the inspired apostles (1 Cor. 4:15-16; 11:1). The Greek word *mimētēs,* translated "imitator," refers to "one who imitates someone else" (Louw and Nida, 508).

> For if you were to have countless tutors in Christ, yet you would not have many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel. Therefore, I exhort you, be **imitators** of me (1 Cor. 4:15-16).

> Be **imitators** of me, just as I also am of Christ (1 Cor. 11:1).

Paul encouraged the Philippians to "join in following my example" which served as an inspired apostolic "pattern" (Phil. 3:17-19). By employing *summimētēs,* i.e., "one who joins others as an imitator, fellow-imitator" (BDAG, 958), the apostle acknowledges that he also must conform to the example and teaching of Jesus Christ.

> "Brethren, join in following my **example**, and observe those who walk according to the pattern you have in us. For many walk, of whom I often told you, and now tell you even weeping, that they are enemies of the cross of Christ, whose end is destruction, whose god is their appetite, and whose glory is in their shame, who set their minds on earthly things (Phil. 3:17-19).

The Bible also stresses certain principles to direct us in implementing God's ways. Would this be true of the Love or Law approach? Notice the following ones:

Consider the seed sowing principle: The functions of a seed is to transmit life and transmit the parental traits to the offspring. From the beginning of creation, every seed produces after its kind---in both the physical and spiritual realms (Gen. 1:11-12; Luke 8:11; 1 Pet. 1:22-25).

> Then God said, "Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees on the earth bearing fruit after their kind with seed in them;" and it was so. The earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit with seed in them, after their kind; and God saw that it was good" (Gen. 1:11-12).

> Now the parable is this: the seed is the word of God (Luke 8:11).

> Since you have in obedience to the truth purified your souls for a sincere love of the brethren, fervently love one another from the heart, for you have been born again not of seed which is perishable but imperishable, that is, through the living and enduring word of God. For, "ALL FLESH IS LIKE GRASS, AND ALL ITS GLORY LIKE THE FLOWER OF GRASS. THE GRASS WITHERS, AND THE FLOWER FALLS OFF, BUT THE WORD OF THE LORD ENDURES FOREVER." And this is the word which was preached to you (1 Pet. 1:22-25).

Let us consider Paul's practice (1 Cor. 4:16-17; 7:17; 14:33-34, 37; 16:1-2; Phil. 4:9).

> Therefore, I exhort you, be imitators of me. For this reason I have sent to you Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, and he will remind you of my ways which are in Christ, just as I teach everywhere in every church (1 Cor. 4:16-17).

> Only, as the Lord has assigned to each one, as God has called each, in this manner let him walk. And so I direct in all the churches (1 Cor. 7:17).

> for God is not a God of confusion but of peace, as in all the churches of the saints. The women are to keep silent in the churches; for they are not permitted to speak, but are to subject themselves, just as the Law also says (1 Cor. 14:33-34).

> If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, let him recognize that the things which I write to you are the Lord's commandment (1 Cor. 14:37).

> Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I directed the churches of Galatia, so do you also. On the first day of every week, each one of you is to put aside and save, as he may prosper, so that no collections be made when I come (1 Cor. 16:1-2).

> The things you have learned and received and heard and seen in me, practice these things, and the God of peace will be with you (Phil. 4:9).

Let us speak as the oracles of God (1 Pet. 4:11), and enjoy unity of mind and judgment (1 Pet. 4:11).

> Whoever speaks is to do so as one who is speaking the utterances of God; whoever serves is to do so as one who is serving by the strength which God supplies; so that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom belongs the glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen (1 Pet. 4:11).

> Now I exhort you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all agree and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be made complete in the same mind and in the same judgment" (1 Cor. 1:10).

Let us not go beyond what is written (in our thoughts, doctrine, or practice (1 Cor. 4:6).

> Now these things, brethren, I have figuratively applied to myself and Apollos for your sakes, so that in us you may learn not to exceed what is written, so that no one of you will become arrogant in behalf of one against the other (1 Cor. 4:6)

Let us abide in the doctrine or Christ and not transgress/trespass its boundaries (2 John 7-11).

> For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist. Watch yourselves, that you do not lose what we have accomplished, but that you may receive a full reward. Anyone who goes too far and does not abide in the teaching of Christ does not have God; the one who abides in the teaching, he has both the Father and the Son. If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house, and do not give him a greeting; for the one who gives him a greeting participates in his evil deeds (2 John 7-11).

Let us be mindful of the danger of apostasy, not just in the "core areas" but in every area (1 Thess. 2:3; 1 Tim. 4:1-3; 2 Tim. 4:3-4).

> For our exhortation does not come from error or impurity or by way of deceit (1 Thess. 2:3).

> But the Spirit explicitly says that in later times some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and doctrines of demons, by means of the hypocrisy of liars seared in their own conscience as with a branding iron, men who forbid marriage and advocate abstaining from foods which God has created to be gratefully shared in by those who believe and know the truth (1 Tim. 4:1-3).

> For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires, and will turn away their ears from the truth and will turn aside to myths (2 Tim. 4:3-4)

## New Testament Scriptures Are Law, Not Just Love Letters!

There is no doubt that the Scriptures of the New Testament, like those of the Old Testament, speak of law. Notices the following examples:

We are subject to the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus (Rom. 8:2).

> For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death (Rom. 8:2).

We are under law to Christ (1 Cor. 9:21).

> to those who are without law, as without law, though not being without the law of God but under the law of Christ, so that I might win those who are without law (1 Cor. 9:21).

The law of Christ is to be obeyed (Gal. 6:2).

> Bear one another's burdens, and thereby fulfill the law of Christ (Gal. 6:2).

The establishment of the New Testament necessarily implied a change of law, not a removal of all law (Heb. 7:12).

> For when the priesthood is changed, of necessity there takes place a change of law also (Heb. 7:12).

The perfect law of liberty must be followed and the royal law fulfilled (Jas. 1:25; 2:8-10).

> But one who looks intently at the perfect law, the law of liberty, and abides by it, not having become a forgetful hearer but an effectual doer, this man will be blessed in what he does (Jas. 1:25).

> If, however, you are fulfilling the royal law according to the Scripture, "YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF," you are doing well. But if you show partiality, you are committing sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles in one point, he has become guilty of all (Jas. 2:8-10).

## Conclusion

The emphasis of the Scriptures on patterns and principles, as simply laid out above, certainly demonstrates that God's words have the authoritative force of divine law. One cannot get the idea of "love letters" in the New Testament. He must import the idea from elsewhere. There is not enough "wiggle room" to evade the passages concerning law studied in this lesson! Doing so shows that one is seeking to chart his own course in religion.

Every word coming from God's mouth must be examined to discern what it directs people to do (Matt. 4:4; 28:20). Hearing Jesus Christ is only half of what He desires (Matt. 7:21-27; Luke 6:46). Obedience to Jesus Christ is also necessary for eternal salvation (Heb. 5:8-9). The advocates of this "Love Letter" preaching have not yet provided us a clear and authoritative statement of how they know what we must obey and what we don't need to obey.

# Lesson 12: The Power behind Better Bible Study: How Jesus Viewed the Scriptures

## Introduction

For many years, it has been the contention of religious liberals that the Bible is not the very word of God, but that the existential moment that one has with that word can sometimes make it God's word to him for that time and place. They have historically viewed the Scriptures as the product of man's search for God, setting forth man's ideas about God, rather than God's will for him.

More recently, liberals/progressives among God's people have contended that Jesus is our pattern instead of New Testament Scriptures being such. This contention has been born out of the crucible of religious controversy, which also has produced a call for a "new hermeneutic." It is for the benefit of all, particularly those who insist that He is our pattern over Scripture, that we here address the idea that Jesus viewed the Scriptures in a certain way. Of course, the Scriptures available to Him were those of the Old Testament. A later article will examine His use of the Scriptures in relation to the recent call for this "new hermeneutic."

For those who may be unfamiliar with this expression, the term "hermeneutic" refers to the approach that individuals take toward the Bible. *Oxford's English Dictionary* defines the noun as "a method or theory of interpretation" of biblical literature.

## Jesus viewed the Scriptures as the word that came from God.

Mark 7:10-13 clearly shows that Jesus viewed the biblical text as having come from God. He dealt with the Jewish practice of neglecting parents in need by a dedicating of their means to God. In the context, He referred to what Moses had said in the accounts of Exodus and Deuteronomy, and He then accused the Jews of making void the word of God through their tradition in this matter and in other matters. Jesus obviously said that the writings of Moses were equivalent to God's word. He did not here refer to its *becoming* God's word to them at some point when their awareness of its impact suddenly dawned, or when the Holy Spirit brought it to their awareness. It was God's word even while they were guilty of rejecting it in their lives.

> For Moses said, "HONOR YOUR FATHER AND YOUR MOTHER"; and, "HE WHO SPEAKS EVIL OF FATHER OR MOTHER, IS TO BE PUT TO DEATH"; but you say, "If a man says to his father or his mother, whatever I have that would help you is Corban (that is to say, given to God)," you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or his mother; thus invalidating the word of God by your tradition which you have handed down; and you do many things such as that (Mark 7:10-13).

## It was the inerrant and verbally inspired word to Jesus.

By "inerrant" the writer means "free from error," and "verbally inspired" means the very words employed by the writers were endorsed by the Spirit as the product of God's mind. In Matthew 22:31-32, Jesus replied to the enigmatic case of the woman married seven times, as presented by the Sadducees to overcome any idea of a resurrection from the dead or of a spirit surviving death. His reply began with a citation of what God said to Moses at the burning bush: "I am the God of Abraham. . .," because Jesus desired to stress the present tense of the verb—"am". His point was that God is eternally existent, and He based this contention upon the tense of a verb. If Jesus did not believe in the inspiration and inerrancy of the words used in the Scriptures, then His argument falls flat. A similar instance occurs in Paul's explanation of Jesus Christ as the singular "seed" of Abraham—through whom the entire world can be blessed (Gal. 3:16). He built his case on the singular, as opposed to plural, number of the noun used.

> But regarding the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by God: "I AM THE GOD OF ABRAHAM, AND THE GOD OF ISAAC, AND THE GOD OF JACOB'? He is not the God of the dead but of the living" (Matt. 22:31-32).

> Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. He does not say, "And to seeds," as referring to many, but rather to one, "And to your seed," that is, Christ (Gal. 3:16).

## He understood the Scriptures to be authoritative and obligatory.

In John 10:35, He declared, "The Scripture cannot be broken." The traditions of the fathers did not begin to approach this same level. It is quite impossible to deny successfully that Jesus accepted the Scriptures absolutely as the word given by the Father—undiluted and undiminished. Before anyone trifles with the word of truth found in the Bible, he must first contend with Jesus's teaching that it bears the authority of God on its face and is incumbent upon all human beings in its declarations, promises, and warnings. In this connection, He often said that either certain events in His life or His entire ministry fulfilled various Old Testament passages (Matt. 4:14; 21:5; Luke 4:21; 24:27).

> If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture cannot be broken) (John 10:35).

> This was to fulfill what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet. . . (Matt. 4:14).

> SAY TO THE DAUGHTER OF ZION, "BEHOLD YOUR KING IS COMING TO YOU, GENTLE, AND MOUNTED ON A DONKEY, EVEN ON A COLT, THE FOAL OF A BEAST OF BURDEN" (Matt. 21:5).

> And He began to say to them, "Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing" (Luke 4:21).

> Then beginning with Moses and with all the prophets, He explained to them the things concerning Himself in all the Scriptures (Luke 24:27).

## Jesus believed the Scriptures to be historically true.

How else can anyone explain His use of the Old Testament incidents in efforts to teach people? He obviously accepted the historical accuracy of Moses and other Old Testament writers without reservation. His allusions to the creation in Matthew 19:4, to the flood in Noah's day in Matthew 24:37-38, to the incident of Jonah and the great fish in Matthew 12:40, and to the repentance of the people in Nineveh in Matthew 12:41 all depend upon his acceptance of the historically accurate accounts of which they are a part. Other Old Testament events/persons (Abel, Elijah, Elisha, and Daniel) could also be cited in His teaching as sharing in this endorsement.

> And He answered and said, "Have you not read that He who created them from the beginning MADE THEM MALE AND FEMALE. . ." (Matt. 19:4).

> For the coming of the Son of Man will be just like the days of Noah. "For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark. . ." (Matt. 24:37-38).

> for just as JONAH WAS THREE DAYS AND THREE NIGHTS IN THE BELLY OF THE SEA MONSTER, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. "The men of Nineveh will stand up with this generation at the judgment, and will condemn it because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, something greater than Jonah is here (Matt. 12:40-41).

## Jesus believed that the Scriptures were divine teaching in their entirety and vitally beneficial in their effect.

Notice that Jesus said that people should live by the words coming from God; that is, spiritual life depends on them in Matthew 4:4. In the immediate context, we see Satan's misuse of the Scriptures pitted against Jesus's correct employment of them, forcing the conclusion that there are right and wrong ways to interpret and to use the Scriptures. Satan obviously distorted the word of God, whereas Jesus interpreted them correctly and used them accordingly. "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God."

> But He answered and said, "It is written, 'MAN SHALL NOT LIVE ON BREAD ALONE, BUT ON EVERY WORD THAT PROCEEDS OUT OF THE MOUTH OF GOD" (Matt. 4:4)

## Conclusion

The view that Jesus held of the Scriptures—a high and lofty one—should dictate our view. Such a high regard for the words that God has given will affect our interpretation of them, our use of them, and our response to them. It makes for *Better Bible Study.*

# Lesson 13: The Practicality of Better Bible Study: How Jesus Used the Scriptures

## Introduction

One's view of the Scriptures affects his use of them. We need go no further in Better Bible Study to learn this principle than the life of Jesus Christ, though we can also observe the principle in other ways. Jesus used the Old Testament writings as he did because He believed them to be divine in origin, inerrant in nature, obligatory in authority, and historically true in account.

If Jesus, the Son of God, held such a high view of the Scriptures, then His disciples must view them similarly. It is a denial of Christ's authority over us and of our own discipleship for us to have an inferior view to His. It is also equally incumbent upon us to use them as He used them, understanding that proper usage of the Bible is the natural consequence of the correct view of it.

The call for a "new hermeneutic" in recent decades is the occasion and impetus for such a study as this, and for the resulting examination of Jesus in this particular matter. Jesus is central in such a study because those demanding a novel approach to the Bible also insist that Jesus must be our pattern in spiritual matters, not the New Testament Scriptures. Proponents of this new approach allege that early Christians did not have a pattern in Scripture because the New Testament canon did not exist until a few centuries later.

It is necessary to point out that their insistence on Jesus, rather than Scriptures, separates Jesus from the Scriptures. If the New Testament is no pattern, then Jesus's pattern exists apart from the New Testament---therefore, we cannot learn Jesus from the New Testament, with the two being separate entities and the New testament being less than a pattern. How could anyone ever hope to come to any definite conclusions about Jesus Christ without the help of the Scriptures? The recent heretical assertions of the Jesus Seminar are primary evidence of the course that becomes inevitable when one rejects the validity of the New Testament in revealing Jesus in His entirety.

How did Jesus use the Scriptures available to Him? Matthew 19 provides us with an answer. In learning this, we also can learn some principles concerning marriage.

## Jesus Used Sacred Scripture to Set Forth Divine Law.

Instances of Jesus's use in this area are too many to cite. Consider His teaching concerning marriage in Matthew 19:3-6. The Lord obviously taught that the marital relation is one for male and female and is indissoluble. He taught concerning marriage based upon what the Scriptures of the Old Testament said, as is demonstrated by His question "Have you not read. . .?" On this solid foundation of what God had said, He then stated His will in the matter.

> Some Pharisees came to Jesus, testing Him and asking, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason at all?" And He answered and said, "Have you not read that He who created them from the beginning MADE THEM MALE AND FEMALE, and said, 'FOR THIS REASON A MAN SHALL LEAVE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER AND BE JOINED TO HIS WIFE, AND THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH'? So they are no longer two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate" (Matt. 19:3-6).

The Pharisees' question, "Is it lawful. . .?" may have presumed some traditional or rabbinical law, but Jesus clearly and emphatically positioned Himself on the rock of what was written in the Scriptures. No other foundation exists for divine law, and no other should be sought. Only the citations of Scriptures have the ring of authority and the obligation of law to disciples of Jesus Christ. Let men deride teaching that cites "book, chapter, and verse," but we stress that in doing so, they break rank with the Son of God; those using this tried-and-true approach are in good company with the Lord Himself.

## Jesus Used the Scriptures to Show Us How to Interpret the Scriptures. 

In verses 4-6 of Matthew 19, Jesus cites a biblical example and a direct biblical statement and then stated a necessary inference. His example was that of the divine creation of man (v. 4), and His statement was a citation of Genesis 2:24. From these two kinds of divine evidence, Jesus then drew a conclusion that necessarily follows in verse 6. The conclusion shows that marriage is designed to be a permanent relationship, and it is expressed as a negative hortatory statement having the force of a command, ". . .Let not man put asunder."

> For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother, and be joined to his wife; and they shall become one flesh (Gen. 2:24).

If Jesus is our pattern for anything, then He is our pattern in how to construe the Sacred Writings. We can do no better than He did! May we ever look to Him as our Teacher, on this subject, as in all others. When modern religionists protest this approach as "legalistic," let us remind them that they need to follow Jesus as the pattern for following the pattern of the Scriptures, or else let them stop claiming that He is our pattern.

## Jesus Used the Scriptures to Apply God's Will to All.

Jesus said that this teaching applies to every person, as comprehended by the term "whosoever" in verse 9. He gave no indication in this passage or elsewhere that this teaching was restricted only to those in covenant relation with God (the saved). How would one learn such, or what evidence is there? His reference to creation of man shows that God's will for marriage is for all human beings thus created. Other passages also show that all human beings are subject to the Lord's law about marriage, by the Bible's repeated use of the term "adultery," which always assumes a marital relation and shows at least one married person involved in the adultery (1 Cor. 6:9; Gal. 5:19).

> Some Pharisees came to Jesus, testing Him and asking, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason at all?" And He answered and said, "Have you not read that He who created them from the beginning MADE THEM MALE AND FEMALE, and said, 'FOR THIS REASON A MAN SHALL LEAVE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER AND BE JOINED TO HIS WIFE, AND THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH'? So they are no longer two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate." They *said to Him, "Why then did Moses command to GIVE HER A CERTIFICATE OF DIVORCE AND SEND her AWAY?" He *said to them, "Because of your hardness of heart Moses permitted you to divorce your wives; but from the beginning it has not been this way. And I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery" (Matt. 19:3-9).

> Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, will inherit the kingdom of God. Such were some of you; but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God (1 Cor. 6:9-11).

> Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are: immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions, envying, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these, of which I forewarn you, just as I have forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God (Gal. 5:19-21).

If such biblical citations do not show that Christ's marriage law applicable to alien sinners, then where would one turn in the Bible to learn biblical justification for marriage on the part of an alien? What passage would authorizes such a marriage?

## Conclusion

Jesus's profound respect for God's Word caused Him to use the Scriptures carefully. His love for people caused Him to expound (*hermeneuo*) the Scriptures with urgency (2 Tim. 4:1-2).

> I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by His appearing and His kingdom: preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with great patience and instruction (2 Tim. 4:1-2).

If Jesus were present on earth today, He would carefully and lovingly explain the word of God to men and women. To be His followers, we must do the same.
