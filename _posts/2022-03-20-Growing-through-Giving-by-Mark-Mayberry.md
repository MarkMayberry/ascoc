## Introduction

In his closing comments to the Ephesian elders, Paul quoted a familiar saying of Jesus that is not preserved in the gospels: "It is more blessed to give than to receive" (Acts 20:32-35, esp. v. 35).

> And now I commend you to God and to the word of His grace, which is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified. I have coveted no one's silver or gold or clothes. You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my own needs and to the men who were with me. In everything I showed you that by working hard in this manner you must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that He Himself said, "It is more blessed to give than to receive" (Acts 20:32-35).

Good/godly parents teach their children to share. By nature, infants focus on their wants and desires. When hungry, disturbed, or uncomfortable, they cry or otherwise communicate their displeasure.

As babies grow, they begin to recognize that they are not the center of the universe. They learn to interact with siblings and other children.

With parental persistence and patience, children must be trained to share---their toys and treasures, time and attention from their parents, the rewards and recognition for a job well done, etc.

God expects us to continue learning this lesson---growing through giving---over the course of our entire lives.

## Sacrificing to God

From the opening of human history, God required sacrifices and offerings. Consider the examples of Cain and Abel (Gen. 4:3-5), Noah (Gen. 8:20), Abraham (Gen. 12:7-8; etc.), Isaac (Gen. 26:25), Jacob (Gen. 31:54), etc.

After Israel became a nation, united in covenant relationship with God, this concept was expanded:

Sacrifices were offered morning and evening, on the Sabbath, new moons, and at the annual festivals of Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles. The day of atonement was a time of solemn reflection and sacrifice.

In addition, the people offered sacrifices of thanksgiving, heave and wave offerings, along with votive or free-will offerings (Exod. 35:20-29).

> Then all the congregation of the sons of Israel departed from Moses' presence. **Everyone whose heart stirred him and everyone whose spirit moved him came and brought the LORD'S contribution for the work of the tent of meeting and for all its service and for the holy garments. Then all whose hearts moved them, both men and women, came and brought brooches and earrings and signet rings and bracelets, all articles of gold; so did every man who presented an offering of gold to the LORD.** Every man, who had in his possession blue and purple and scarlet material and fine linen and goats' hair and rams' skins dyed red and porpoise skins, brought them. Everyone who could make a contribution of silver and bronze brought the LORD'S contribution; and every man who had in his possession acacia wood for any work of the service brought it. All the skilled women spun with their hands, and brought what they had spun, in blue and purple and scarlet material and in fine linen. All the women whose heart stirred with a skill spun the goats' hair. The rulers brought the onyx stones and the stones for setting for the ephod and for the breastpiece; and the spice and the oil for the light and for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense. **The Israelites, all the men and women, whose heart moved them to bring material for all the work, which the LORD had commanded through Moses to be done, brought a freewill offering to the LORD** (Exod. 35:20-29).

This principle applied even to the poor (Lev. 14:20-22; 5:11-13), and was reflected by the actions of Joseph and Mary when they presented the Christ-child in the temple (Luke 2:21-24).

> The priest shall offer up the burnt offering and the grain offering on the altar. Thus the priest shall make atonement for him, and he will be clean. But if he is poor and his means are insufficient, then he is to take one male lamb for a guilt offering as a wave offering to make atonement for him, and one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering, and a log of oil, and two turtledoves or two young pigeons which are within his means, the one shall be a sin offering and the other a burnt offering (Lev. 14:20-22)

> But if his means are insufficient for two turtledoves or two young pigeons, then for his offering for that which he has sinned, he shall bring the tenth of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he shall not put oil on it or place incense on it, for it is a sin offering. He shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it as its memorial portion and offer it up in smoke on the altar, with the offerings of the LORD by fire: it is a sin offering. So the priest shall make atonement for him concerning his sin which he has committed from one of these, and it will be forgiven him; then the rest shall become the priest's, like the grain offering (Lev. 5:11-13).

> And when eight days had passed, before His circumcision, His name was then called Jesus, the name given by the angel before He was conceived in the womb. And when the days for their purification according to the law of Moses were completed, they brought Him up to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord (as it is written in the Law of the Lord, "EVERY firstborn MALE THAT OPENS THE WOMB SHALL BE CALLED HOLY TO THE LORD"), and to offer a sacrifice according to what was said in the Law of the Lord, "A PAIR OF TURTLEDOVES OR TWO YOUNG PIGEONS" (Luke 2:21-24).

Godly parents will teach their children to sacrifice unto God, even when they are "poor," i.e., when they have no independent sources of income other than their allowance or the small amount they earn for doing chores.

In the gospel age, the principle of individual responsibility is clearly set forth in Paul's letters to the Corinthians:

> Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I directed the churches of Galatia, so do you also. On the first day of every week, each one of you is to put aside and save, as he may prosper, so that no collections be made when I come. When I arrive, whomever you may approve, I will send them with letters to carry your gift to Jerusalem; and if it is fitting for me to go also, they will go with me (1 Cor. 16:1–4).

> Now, brethren, we wish to make known to you the grace of God which has been given in the churches of Macedonia, that in a great ordeal of affliction their abundance of joy and their deep poverty overflowed in the wealth of their liberality. For I testify that according to their ability, and beyond their ability, they gave of their own accord, begging us with much urging for the favor of participation in the support of the saints, and this, not as we had expected, but they first gave themselves to the Lord and to us by the will of God (2 Corinthians 8:1–5).

> For it is superfluous for me to write to you about this ministry to the saints; for I know your readiness, of which I boast about you to the Macedonians, namely, that Achaia has been prepared since last year, and your zeal has stirred up most of them. But I have sent the brethren, in order that our boasting about you may not be made empty in this case, so that, as I was saying, you may be prepared; otherwise if any Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we—not to speak of you—will be put to shame by this confidence. So I thought it necessary to urge the brethren that they would go on ahead to you and arrange beforehand your previously promised bountiful gift, so that the same would be ready as a bountiful gift and not affected by covetousness. Now this I say, he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. Each one must do just as he has purposed in his heart, not grudgingly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that always having all sufficiency in everything, you may have an abundance for every good deed; as it is written, "HE SCATTERED ABROAD, HE GAVE TO THE POOR, HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS ENDURES FOREVER." Now He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness; you will be enriched in everything for all liberality, which through us is producing thanksgiving to God. For the ministry of this service is not only fully supplying the needs of the saints, but is also overflowing through many thanksgivings to God. Because of the proof given by this ministry, they will glorify God for your obedience to your confession of the gospel of Christ and for the liberality of your contribution to them and to all, while they also, by prayer on your behalf, yearn for you because of the surpassing grace of God in you. Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift! (2 Cor. 9:1–15).

## Sacrificing for Others

This duty was emphasized in the Old Testament (Ps. 41:1-3; Prov. 19:17; Isa. 58:1–8) and in the gospel dispensation (Matt. 25:34-40; Heb. 13:16; 1 John 3:16–18).

> How blessed is he who considers the helpless; the LORD will deliver him in a day of trouble (Ps. 41:1-3).

> One who is gracious to a poor man lends to the LORD, and He will repay him for his good deed (Prov. 19:17).

> Cry loudly, do not hold back; Raise your voice like a trumpet, And declare to My people their transgression And to the house of Jacob their sins. Yet they seek Me day by day and delight to know My ways, As a nation that has done righteousness And has not forsaken the ordinance of their God. They ask Me for just decisions, They delight in the nearness of God. 'Why have we fasted and You do not see? Why have we humbled ourselves and You do not notice?' Behold, on the day of your fast you find your desire, And drive hard all your workers. Behold, you fast for contention and strife and to strike with a wicked fist. You do not fast like you do today to make your voice heard on high. Is it a fast like this which I choose, a day for a man to humble himself? Is it for bowing one's head like a reed And for spreading out sackcloth and ashes as a bed? Will you call this a fast, even an acceptable day to the LORD? Is this not the fast which I choose, To loosen the bonds of wickedness, To undo the bands of the yoke, And to let the oppressed go free And break every yoke? Is it not to divide your bread with the hungry And bring the homeless poor into the house; When you see the naked, to cover him; And not to hide yourself from your own flesh? Then your light will break out like the dawn, And your recovery will speedily spring forth; And your righteousness will go before you; The glory of the LORD will be your rear guard (Isa. 58:1–8).

> Then the King will say to those on His right, "Come, you who are blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was hungry, and you gave Me something to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave Me something to drink; I was a stranger, and you invited Me in; naked, and you clothed Me; I was sick, and you visited Me; I was in prison, and you came to Me." Then the righteous will answer Him, "Lord, when did we see You hungry, and feed You, or thirsty, and give You something to drink? And when did we see You a stranger, and invite You in, or naked, and clothe You? When did we see You sick, or in prison, and come to You?" The King will answer and say to them, "Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did it to one of these brothers of Mine, even the least of them, you did it to Me" (Matt. 25:34-40).

> And do not neglect doing good and sharing, for with such sacrifices God is pleased (Heb. 13:16).

> We know love by this, that He laid down His life for us; and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. But whoever has the world's goods, and sees his brother in need and closes his heart against him, how does the love of God abide in him? Little children, let us not love with word or with tongue, but in deed and truth (1 John 3:16–18).

## Conclusion

Based upon the aforementioned passages, we learn that we must sacrifice for others and also offer gifts to God. Based upon Paul's command in 1 Corinthian 16::1-5, the duty of Christian giving must be practiced:

Universally: "Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I directed the churches of Galatia, so do you also."

Regularly: "On the first day of every week. . ."

Individually: "each one of you is to put aside and save. . ."

Proportionately: ". . .as he may prosper. . ."

Preparedly: ". . .so that no collections be made when I come."

Prudently: "When I arrive, whomever you may approve, I will send them with letters to carry your gift to Jerusalem. . ."
