## Introduction

The Wisdom Literature repeatedly warns against the sin of pride (Prov. 8:13; 11:2; 21:24; 29:23).

> The fear of the LORD is to hate evil; pride and arrogance and the evil way and the perverted mouth, I hate (Prov. 8:13).

> When pride comes, then comes dishonor, but with the humble is wisdom (Prov. 11:2).

> "Proud," "Haughty," "Scoffer," are his names, who acts with insolent pride (Prov. 21:24).

> A man's pride will bring him low, but a humble spirit will obtain honor (Prov. 29:23).

This lesson, we consider thee portraits of pride as depicted in the Bible: King Uzziah, Diotrephes, and the Pharisees.

When used of art, the word "portrait" refers to "(1) a painting, drawing, photograph, or engraving of a person, especially one depicting only the face or head and shoulders; (2) a representation or impression of someone or something in language or on film."

For the sake of illustrations, let us briefly consider several famous portraits from the fields of painting, photography, and literature.

## Pride of Performance

Like King Uzziah, some manifest pride in the performance of some duty (2 Chron. 26:16-21).

> But when he became strong, his heart was so proud that he acted corruptly, and he was unfaithful to the LORD his God, for he entered the temple of the LORD to burn incense on the altar of incense. Then Azariah the priest entered after him and with him eighty priests of the LORD, valiant men. They opposed Uzziah the king and said to him, "It is not for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the LORD, but for the priests, the sons of Aaron who are consecrated to burn incense. Get out of the sanctuary, for you have been unfaithful and will have no honor from the LORD God." But Uzziah, with a censer in his hand for burning incense, was enraged; and while he was enraged with the priests, the leprosy broke out on his forehead before the priests in the house of the LORD, beside the altar of incense. Azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked at him, and behold, he was leprous on his forehead; and they hurried him out of there, and he himself also hastened to get out because the LORD had smitten him. King Uzziah was a leper to the day of his death; and he lived in a separate house, being a leper, for he was cut off from the house of the LORD. And Jotham his son was over the king's house judging the people of the land (2 Chron. 26:16-21).

As a member of the tribe of Judah, and a descendant of David, Uzziah already possessed a privileged position. Unfortunately, this was seemingly not enough. In the OT dispensation, God assigned certain duties to the Levites.  Uzziah became a usurper.

UZZIAH [you ZIE uh] (the Lord is my strength) — the name of five men in the Old Testament:

The son of Amaziah and Jecholiah; ninth king of Judah and father of Jotham (2 Kin. 15:1-7; 2 Chr. 26). Uzziah is also called Azariah (2 Kin. 14:21; 15:1-7).

Uzziah ascended the throne at age 16 and reigned longer than any previous king of Judah or Israel—52 years. He probably co-reigned with his father and had his son Jotham as his co-regent during his final years as a leper. A wise, pious, and powerful king, he extended Judah's territory and brought the nation to a time of great prosperity. In the south he maintained control over Edom and rebuilt port facilities at Elath on the Gulf of Aqaba. To the west he warred against the Philistines, seizing several cities. He also apparently defeated and subdued the Ammonites.
The foolishness of Uzziah's father Amaziah in fighting Joash, the king of Israel, had left the city of Jerusalem in a vulnerable position (2 Chr. 25:23). So Uzziah focused his attention on securing the defenses of both his capital and his country. He reinforced the towers of the city gates. On these towers and walls he placed huge catapults capable of shooting arrows and hurling stones at the enemy (2 Chr. 26:15). He also maintained a well-equipped army and fortified strategic places in the desert. His successes were directly related to his spiritual sensitivity, because he sought the Lord through a prophet who encouraged him to honor and obey God (2 Chr. 26:5).

However, Uzziah's heart was lifted up in pride. No longer satisfied to be a mortal king, he desired to be like some of his contemporaries—a divine king. He entered the Temple to burn incense. When Azariah the high priest and 80 associates confronted him, he responded in anger instead of repentance. God judged him by striking him with leprosy. Uzziah was forced to live the rest of his life in a separate place, with his son Jotham probably acting as king. At Uzziah's death the prophet Isaiah had a transforming vision of the Lord, high and lifted up on a throne (Is. 1:1; 6:1-13; 7:1).

## Pride of Position

Like Diotrephes, some manifest pride in their position (3 John 9-12).

> I wrote something to the church; but Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them, does not accept what we say. For this reason, if I come, I will call attention to his deeds which he does, unjustly accusing us with wicked words; and not satisfied with this, he himself does not receive the brethren, either, and he forbids those who desire to do so and puts them out of the church. Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. The one who does good is of God; the one who does evil has not seen God. Demetrius has received a good testimony from everyone, and from the truth itself; and we add our testimony, and you know that our testimony is true (3 John 9-12).

DIOTROPHES [die OTT ruh fees] (nourished by Jupiter) — an unruly believer reprimanded by John (3 John 9-10). He appears to have been a strong personality or a prominent church leader who rejected both John and certain of his followers. Diotrophes stands in contrast to both Gaius (verse 1) and Demetrius (verse 12).

## Pride in Piety

Like the Pharisees, some manifest pride in their own piety (Luke 18:9-14; cf. Matt. 6:1-8, 16-18).

> I wrote something to the church And He also told this parable to some people who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and viewed others with contempt: "Two men went up into the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. The Pharisee stood and was praying this to himself: 'God, I thank You that I am not like other people: swindlers, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector. 'I fast twice a week; I pay tithes of all that I get.' But the tax collector, standing some distance away, was even unwilling to lift up his eyes to heaven, but was beating his breast, saying, 'God, be merciful to me, the sinner!' I tell you, this man went to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted" (Luke 18:9-14).

> Beware of practicing your righteousness before men to be noticed by them; otherwise you have no reward with your Father who is in heaven. So when you give to the poor, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may be honored by men. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full. But when you give to the poor, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving will be in secret; and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you. When you pray, you are not to be like the hypocrites; for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on the street corners so that they may be seen by men. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full. But you, when you pray, go into your inner room, close your door and pray to your Father who is in secret, and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you. And when you are praying, do not use meaningless repetition as the Gentiles do, for they suppose that they will be heard for their many words. So do not be like them; for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him (Matt. 6:1-8).

> Whenever you fast, do not put on a gloomy face as the hypocrites do, for they neglect their appearance so that they will be noticed by men when they are fasting. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full. But you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face so that your fasting will not be noticed by men, but by your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you (Matt. 6:16-18).

## Conclusion

Humility is essential if we hope to share a relationship with God, both in time and eternity (Isa. 57:14-15; Micah 6:6-8).

> And it will be said, "Build up, build up, prepare the way, Remove every obstacle out of the way of My people." For thus says the high and exalted One Who lives forever, whose name is Holy, "I dwell on a high and holy place, And also with the contrite and lowly of spirit In order to revive the spirit of the lowly And to revive the heart of the contrite" (Isa. 57:14-15).

> With what shall I come to the LORD And bow myself before the God on high? Shall I come to Him with burnt offerings, With yearling calves? Does the LORD take delight in thousands of rams, In ten thousand rivers of oil? Shall I present my firstborn for my rebellious acts, The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? He has told you, O man, what is good; And what does the LORD require of you But to do justice, to love kindness, And to walk humbly with your God? (Micah 6:6-8).
