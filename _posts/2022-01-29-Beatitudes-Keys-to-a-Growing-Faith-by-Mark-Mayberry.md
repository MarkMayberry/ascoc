# The Beatitudes: Keys to a Growing Faith

by Mark Mayberry

## Introduction

Let's consider the beatitudes (Matt. 5:1-11), each of which begins with "blessed," i.e., fortunate. These brief statements capture the concept of growth. 

The Greek word *makarios,* translated "blessed" and occurring 9 times in this context, is defined by Arndt as pertaining to "(1) being fortunate or happy because of circumstances, *fortunate, happy;* (2) being especially favored, *blessed, fortunate, happy, privileged,* from a transcendent perspective. . ." (BDAG, 610-611).

> When Jesus saw the crowds, He went up on the mountain; and after He sat down, His disciples came to Him. He opened His mouth and began to teach them, saying, Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted. Blessed are the gentle, for they shall inherit the earth. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied. Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God. Blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of Me. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward in heaven is great; for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you" (Matt. 5:1-12).

## The Beginnings of Faith

The first four beatitudes address the beginnings of faith. 

### Blessed Are the Poor in Spirit

*Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven (Matt. 5:3).*

Lost in sin and separated from God, all are impoverished in spirit. This is true of the powerful and the prideful, the successful and the self-satisfied (Isa. 64:6-7; Rom. 3:23).

> For all of us have become like one who is unclean, And all our righteous deeds are like a filthy garment; And all of us wither like a leaf, And our iniquities, like the wind, take us away. There is no one who calls on Your name, Who arouses himself to take hold of You; For You have hidden Your face from us And have delivered us into the power of our iniquities (Isa. 64:6-7).

> for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (Rom. 3:23).

Accordingly, we must recognize our alienated state, and humble ourselves before God (Isa. 57:15; Luke 15:17–21).

> For thus says the high and exalted One Who lives forever, whose name is Holy, "I dwell on a high and holy place, And also with the contrite and lowly of spirit In order to revive the spirit of the lowly And to revive the heart of the contrite (Isa. 57:15).

> But when he came to his senses, he said, "How many of my father's hired men have more than enough bread, but I am dying here with hunger! I will get up and go to my father, and will say to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight; I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me as one of your hired men.'" So he got up and came to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and felt compassion for him, and ran and embraced him and kissed him. And the son said to him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight; I am no longer worthy to be called your son" (Luke 15:17–21).

### Blessed Are Those Who Mourn

*Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted (Matt. 5:4).*

If we hope to find forgiveness, we must mourn over our fallen state, and reach the point of genuine repentance (Acts 11:17–18; 2 Cor. 7:8–11).

> Therefore if God gave to them the same gift as He gave to us also after believing in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could stand in God's way?" When they heard this, they quieted down and glorified God, saying, "Well then, God has granted to the Gentiles also the repentance that leads to life" (Acts 11:17–18).

> For though I caused you sorrow by my letter, I do not regret it; though I did regret it—for I see that that letter caused you sorrow, though only for a while— I now rejoice, not that you were made sorrowful, but that you were made sorrowful to the point of repentance; for you were made sorrowful according to the will of God, so that you might not suffer loss in anything through us. For the sorrow that is according to the will of God produces a repentance without regret, leading to salvation, but the sorrow of the world produces death. For behold what earnestness this very thing, this godly sorrow, has produced in you: what vindication of yourselves, what indignation, what fear, what longing, what zeal, what avenging of wrong! In everything you demonstrated yourselves to be innocent in the matter (2 Cor. 7:8–11).

### Blessed are the Gentle/Meek

*Blessed are the gentle, for they shall inherit the earth (Matt. 5:5).*

Meekness does not describe weakness or timidity, but strength under control, as a rudder controls a ship, and a bridle controls a horse. We need an obedient spirit, as was reflected in the life of Jesus (Matt. 11:;28-30; Heb. 5:8-9). As Paul sought to keep his body under control, we must strive to do the same (1 Cor. 9:24-27). 

> Come to Me, all who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and YOU WILL FIND REST FOR YOUR SOULS. For My yoke is easy and My burden is light (Matt. 11:28–30).

> Although He was a Son, He learned obedience from the things which He suffered. And having been made perfect, He became to all those who obey Him the source of eternal salvation (Heb. 5:8-9).

> Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but only one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may win. Everyone who competes in the games exercises self-control in all things. They then do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable. Therefore I run in such a way, as not without aim; I box in such a way, as not beating the air; but I discipline my body and make it my slave, so that, after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified (1 Cor. 9:24-27).

### Blessed Are Those Who Hunger and Thirst for Righteousness

*Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied (Matt. 5:6).*

We must also develop a longing for spiritual knowledge and understanding (Ps. 1). Consider the eager attitude that new converts often show toward learning biblical truths and compare this to the apathy that lukewarm and lazy members manifest.

> How blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked, Nor stand in the path of sinners, Nor sit in the seat of scoffers! But his delight is in the law of the LORD, And in His law he meditates day and night. He will be like a tree firmly planted by streams of water, Which yields its fruit in its season And its leaf does not wither; And in whatever he does, he prospers. The wicked are not so, But they are like chaff which the wind drives away. Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, Nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous. For the LORD knows the way of the righteous, But the way of the wicked will perish (Ps. 1).

## The Perfecting of Faith

The next three beatitudes emphasize the need for faith to be perfected.

### Blessed Are the Merciful

*Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy (Matt. 5:7).*

We must be compassionate toward the lost, toward our brethren, and our family (Luke 6:36; Col. 3:12–13). As we consider their destiny, let us share the blessings of salvation which we have received with others

> Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful (Luke 6:36).

> So, as those who have been chosen of God, holy and beloved, put on a heart of compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience; bearing with one another, and forgiving each other, whoever has a complaint against anyone; just as the Lord forgave you, so also should you (Col. 3:12–13).

### Blessed Are the Pure in Heart

*Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God (Matt. 5:8).*

Purity communicates the concept of that which is singular, unadulterated, unmixed. While we sometimes lose focus, we must strive for singular vision. Let us, therefore, cultivate pure hearts (1 Tim. 1:5; 2 Tim. 2:22).

> But the goal of our instruction is love from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith (1 Tim. 1:5).

> Now flee from youthful lusts and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart (2 Tim. 2:22).

### Blessed Are the Peacemakers

*Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God (Matt. 5:9).*

Blessed are the peacemakers. Who are the peacemakers? We must be peace-practitioners and peace-preachers. 

As Peter spoke to the household of Cornelius, he said, "We preach the gospel of peace," i.e., we present the means by which sinful man can be restored to a peaceful/harmonious relationship with God. The gospel is a message of peace, breaking down the barrier that exists between God and man because of sin (Eph. 2:14-15). It also contains principles that help us live peaceably with others (Rom. 12:18-21).

> For He Himself is our peace, who made both groups into one and broke down the barrier of the dividing wall, by abolishing in His flesh the enmity, which is the Law of commandments contained in ordinances, so that in Himself He might make the two into one new man, thus establishing peace (Eph. 2:14-15).

> If possible, so far as it depends on you, be at peace with all men. Never take your own revenge, beloved, but leave room for the wrath of God, for it is written, "VENGEANCE IS MINE, I WILL REPAY," says the Lord. "BUT IF YOUR ENEMY IS HUNGRY, FEED HIM, AND IF HE IS THIRSTY, GIVE HIM A DRINK; FOR IN SO DOING YOU WILL HEAP BURNING COALS ON HIS HEAD." Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good (Rom. 12:18-21).

## The Trials/Testing of Faith

The final beatitudes deal with trials/testing of one's faith.

*Blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven (Matt. 5:10).*

*Blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of Me (Matt. 5:11).*

Being a Christian is not all unicorns and rainbows. Obedience to the gospel can cause strive among family members, conflict in the workplace, and society as a whole. We will be tested, tried, and even persecuted. If this occurs, we should not be discouraged, but thankful that God has enough confidence in us that He permits us to be so tested (Job 1:8-12; 1 Pet. 4:14-16). 

> The LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered My servant Job? For there is no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, fearing God and turning away from evil." Then Satan answered the LORD, "Does Job fear God for nothing? Have You not made a hedge about him and his house and all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land. But put forth Your hand now and touch all that he has; he will surely curse You to Your face." Then the LORD said to Satan, "Behold, all that he has is in your power, only do not put forth your hand on him." So Satan departed from the presence of the LORD (Job 1:8-12).

> If you are reviled for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you. Make sure that none of you suffers as a murderer, or thief, or evildoer, or a troublesome meddler; but if anyone suffers as a Christian, he is not to be ashamed, but is to glorify God in this name (1 Pet. 4:14-16).

When Peter and John were arrested, tried, and threatened for preaching the gospel, they rejoiced that they were considered worthy to suffer for His name (Acts 5:41-42).

> So they went on their way from the presence of the Council, rejoicing that they had been considered worthy to suffer shame for His name. And every day, in the temple and from house to house, they kept right on teaching and preaching Jesus as the Christ (Acts 5:41-42).

## The Reward of Faith

The concluding verse focuses upon  the rewards of faith.

*Rejoice and be glad, for your reward in heaven is great; for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you (Matt. 5:12).*

There is a prize awaiting hte faithful. The apostles Paul and John both warned against allowing someone to rob us of our prize (Col. 2:18-19; 2 John 8-9) Near the end of his life, Paul spoke of the crown that awaits all those who love His appearing. 

> Let no one keep defrauding you of your prize by delighting in self-abasement and the worship of the angels, taking his stand on visions he has seen, inflated without cause by his fleshly mind, and not holding fast to the head, from whom the entire body, being supplied and held together by the joints and ligaments, grows with a growth which is from God (Col. 2:18-19).

> Watch yourselves, that you do not lose what we have accomplished, but that you may receive a full reward. Anyone who goes too far and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God; the one who abides in the teaching, he has both the Father and the Son (2 John 8-9).

## Conclusion

Each of us should diligently determine to grow (2 Pet. 1:5-11). Are you diligently striving to grow on a daily basis?

> Now for this very reason also, applying all diligence, in your faith supply moral excellence, and in your moral excellence, knowledge, and in your knowledge, self-control, and in your self-control, perseverance, and in your perseverance, godliness, and in your godliness, brotherly kindness, and in your brotherly kindness, love. For if these qualities are yours and are increasing, they render you neither useless nor unfruitful in the true knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. For he who lacks these qualities is blind or short-sighted, having forgotten his purification from his former sins. Therefore, brethren, be all the more diligent to make certain about His calling and choosing you; for as long as you practice these things, you will never stumble; for in this way the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be abundantly supplied to you (2 Pet. 1:5-11).
