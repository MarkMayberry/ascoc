Here is a lesson, presented by Mark Mayberry at the Adoue Street Church of Christ in Alvin, TX on Sunday evening (2/16/2014), entitled “Making a Covenant with Our Eyes.”

Sunday evening, we took a temporary break from our study of Genesis to consider the statement of Job: “I have made a covenant with my eyes; How then could I gaze at a virgin?” (Job 31:1-12).  In a standardless age that has lost all sense of decency and decorum, Christian men should seek to live according to the noble principles expressed by the patriarch, and remember the words of the Lord Jesus: “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not commit adultery’; but I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart” (Matt. 5:27-30).
