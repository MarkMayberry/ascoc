Introduction

In this lesson, we focus on the issue of division. The New Testament uses vivid words to describe this problem. Accordingly, let us consider the Biblical occurrences of the Greek noun schisma and the related verb schizō. 

The Noun Schisma

Thomas defines σχίσμα [schisma] as from schizō [to cleave, split], meaning “a split, figuratively, division” [4978]. BDAG say it refers to “(1) the condition resulting from splitting or tearing, tear, crack; (2) the condition of being divided because of conflicting aims or objectives, division, dissension, schism figurative extension of 1.” This word occurs 8x in the NT (Matt. 9:16; Mark 2:21; John 7:43; 9:16; 10:19; 1 Cor. 1:10; 11:18; 12:25).

The Verb Schizō

Thomas defines σχίζω [schizō], derived from a primitive root [schid], as “to cleave, split” [4977]. BDAG say it means “(1) to divide by use of force, split, divide, separate, tear apart, tear off literally; (2) to tear apart a group through conflicting aims or objectives, figurative extension of 1.” This word occurs 11x in the NT (Matt. 27:51; Mark 1:10; 15:38; Luke 5:36; 23:45; John 19:24; 21:11; Acts 14:4; 23:7).

Physical Divisions

Immediately after Jesus was baptized, the heavens opened [schizō], the Spirit descended like a dove upon Him, and a voice echoed from the heavens, saying “You are My beloved Son, in You I am well-pleased” (Mark 1:9-11).

Speaking of the changes wrought by His coming, Jesus said, “No one puts a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; for the patch pulls away from the garment, and a worse tear [schisma] results” (Matt. 9:14-17; cf. Mark 2:21; Luke 5:36).

When Jesus died on the cross, the veil of the temple was torn [schizō] in two from top to bottom; and the earth shook and the rocks were split [schizō] (Matt. 27:50-53; cf. Mark 15:38; Luke 23:45; see also Exod. 26:31-35; Heb. 6:19-20).

In contrast, Sacred Scripture refers to several physical things that are not divided. After crucifying Jesus, the Roman soldiers took His outer garments and made four parts, a part to every soldier. Yet, for His tunic, a seamless garment woven in one piece, they said, “Let us not tear [schizō] it, but cast lots for it, to decide whose it shall be” (John 19:23-24; cf. Psa. 22:16-18). Why was it not divided? So that it would not be ruined. 

After His resurrection, Jesus manifested Himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Galilee. The disciples fished all night, but caught nothing. As day was breaking, Jesus called out from the beach, saying, “Cast the net on the right-hand side of the boat and you will find a catch.” Doing so, they were unable to haul it in because of the great number of fish. When they finally reached shore, they drew the net to land, full of large fish, a hundred and fifty-three, and yet, despite the number, the net was not torn [schizō] (John 21:1-11). Why was it not torn? It served as a sign, which stands in contrast with a similar catch that occurred at the beginning of Jesus’ ministry (Luke 5:1-11).

Spiritual Divisions

As people observed the miracles and message of Jesus, a division [schisma] occurred in the crowd because of Him: some were receptive, others were hostile (John 7:40-53, esp. vs. 43). Were both positions right? No. One was based in open-minded acceptance of the truth; the other reflected a close-minded rejection of the same.

This occurred again when Jesus healed the man born blind: Some of the Pharisees were saying, “This man is not from God, because He does not keep the Sabbath.” But others were saying, “How can a man who is a sinner perform such signs?” (John 9:13-34, esp. vs. 16). There was a division [schisma] among them. Were both positions right? No. One was rooted in proper reasoning, while the other was based upon blind hatred.

When Jesus contrasted His ministry with that of the religious establishment of the day, a division [schisma] occurred again among the Jews because of these words. Many said, “He has a demon and is insane. Why do you listen to Him?” Others responded, “These are not the sayings of one demon-possessed. A demon cannot open the eyes of the blind, can he?” (John 10:7-21, esp. vs. 19). Were both positions right? No. One was the result of rational thought, while the other stemmed from illogical insults.

Coming to Iconium, Paul and Barnabas entered the synagogue, and spoke in such a manner that a large number of people believed, both of Jews and of Greeks. They spent considerable time speaking boldly with reliance upon the Lord, who was testifying to the word of His grace, granting that signs and wonders be done by their hands. In contrast, the unbelieving Jews stirred up the minds of the Gentiles and embittered them against the brethren. As a result, the people of the city were divided [schizō], some siding with the Jews and some with the apostles (Acts 14:1-7, esp. vs. 4). Were both positions right? No. One was based upon evidence, while the other was rooted in envy.

When Paul stood before the Jewish Council, that had prejudged his guilt, he effectively shifted the focus from himself to the sectarian divisions between the Pharisees and the Sadducees. Crying out, Paul said, “Brethren, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees; I am on trial for the hope and resurrection of the dead!” As a result, the assembly was divided [schizō] (Acts 23:1-10, esp. vs. 7). Were both positions right? No. One was rooted in divine revelation, while the other derived from the doctrines and traditions of men.

A party spirit existed in the church at Corinth, with various individuals saying, “I am of Paul,” and “I of Apollos,” and “I of Cephas,” and “I of Christ” (1 Cor. 1:10-13). Was this division [schisma] justified? Absolutely not. There were no doctrinal differences in the message of Paul, Apollos, Cephas or Christ. All taught the same thing. This wholly unnecessary division reflected a factious mindset.

Division exists when men depart from the Truth. Paul said, For, in the first place, when you come together as a church, I hear that divisions [schisma] exist among you; and in part I believe it. For there must also be factions among you, so that those who are approved may become evident among you” (1 Cor. 11:17-34, esp. vs. 18-19).

Like a physical body, the church, i.e., the spiritual body of Christ, should be united in practice and preaching and purpose. There should be no division [schisma] in the body; rather, the members should have the same care for one another, suffering with those who suffer, rejoicing with those who rejoice (1 Cor. 12:14-26, esp. vs. 25).

Conclusion

As the sweet Psalmist of Israel said, “How good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity” (Psa. 133:1-3)! Respecting the prayer of Jesus offered on the night of His betrayal, let us seek spiritual oneness with likeminded believers (John 17:20-21). Such is possible only when we maintain the proper disposition and adhere to the proper doctrine (Eph. 4:1-6).
