<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>And behold, two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus, which was about seven miles from Jerusalem. And they were talking with each other about all these things which had taken place.</p></li>
<li><p>While they were talking and discussing, Jesus Himself approached and began traveling with them. But their eyes were prevented from recognizing Him (Luke 24:13-16).</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="the-village-of-emmaus">The Village of Emmaus</h1>
<ul>
<li>Emmaus was a village situated about sixty stadia, or approximately seven and a half miles, west of Jerusalem.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="bdag-on-emmaus">BDAG on Emmaus</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>According to <em>A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature,</em></p></li>
<li><p>Emmaus [was] a village in Judea 60 stades (c. 11.5 k/m) from Jerusalem (Luke 24:13). The site cannot be determined with certainty. Three are proposed: (1) The old Emmaus of Maccabaean times, not infrequently mentioned by Joseph. It is located rather far from Jerusalem for the 60 stades of vs. 13 . . . (2) Since the middle ages some have thought of present-day el-Kubêbe (65 stades from Jerusalem . . . (3) The military colony of Vespasian, about 34 stades west of Jerusalem, called Ammaous in Josephus (BDAG, 322).</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="personal-application">Personal Application?</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>What lessons can we learn from Jesus’s encounter with two men on the road to Emmaus?</p></li>
<li><p>It Was a Road to Reassessment</p></li>
<li><p>It Was a Road to Revelation</p></li>
<li><p>It Was a Road to Relationships</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="thoughtful-reassessment">Thoughtful Reassessment</h1>
<ul>
<li>We encounter Jesus through thoughtful reassessment (Luke 24:17-24).</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="they-got-some-things-right">They Got Some Things Right</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>The two men on the road to Emmaus possessed partial (rather than full) understanding.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, Jesus was a prophet.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, He was mighty in word and deed, both in the sight of God and man.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="they-got-some-things-wrong">They Got Some Things Wrong</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>He was/is our Redeemer, but they they had a misconception regarding the nature of His work.</p></li>
<li><p>He has been raised from the dead, but they had not fully embraced the testimony of women as true.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="achieving-balance">Achieving Balance</h1>
<ul>
<li>While it is important that we possess a firmly rooted belief system (Col. 1:21-23, esp. v. 23), we must also be willing to reassess our assumptions (Acts 17:10-15, esp. v. 11).</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="the-danger-of-conventional-wisdom">The Danger of Conventional Wisdom</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>According to Wikipedia, collective wisdom, also called group wisdom and co-intelligence, is shared knowledge arrived at by individuals and groups. It is also called “the wisdom of the crowd.”</p></li>
<li><p>When viewed negatively, it is also identified as “groupthink” or “herd mentality.”</p></li>
<li><p>Frequently, “groupthink” is reflected in someone “following the crowd” and represents a complete lack of forethought or individual initiative.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="avoiding-groupthink">Avoiding Groupthink</h1>
<ul>
<li>More often than not, groupthink is rooted in collective ignorance and/or cowardice–being factually deficient and utterly false–resulting in gross miscarriages of justice (Exod. 23:1-3; Matt. 27:19-26).</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="examples-of-commonly-held-errors">Examples of Commonly Held Errors</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>The five tenets of Calvinist theology: TULIP.</p></li>
<li><p>The concept that, “It doesn’t mater what you believe if you are sincere.”</p></li>
<li><p>The widely held belief that “Evolution is proven by modern science.”</p></li>
<li><p>The widely held belief that “truth is relative,” or “gender is a fluid/self-defined concept,” or “it is hateful to say that someone is wrong.”</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="human-wisdom-vs-divine-wisdom">Human Wisdom vs Divine Wisdom</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>In the ancient Greco-Roman world, wisdom was valued above all other qualities; in contrast, the Jews asked for signs; yet, the underlying assumptions of both groups blinded them to true wisdom (1 Cor. 1:20-31).</p></li>
<li><p>Instead of being dominated by “collective wisdom,” let us remain curious, and be willing to look at life from a different perspective, namely, “What saith the Scriptures?”</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="through-revelation">Through Revelation</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>We encounter Jesus through divine revelation (Luke 24:25-27; cf. also vv. 44-49).</p></li>
<li><p>The OT foreshadowed the redemptive work of Jesus Christ (Gen. 3:15; 12:3; Num. 21:9 [John 3:14]; Deut. 18:15 [John 1:45]; John 5:46; etc.).</p></li>
<li><p>Our worldview must be founded upon a proper understanding of divine revelation (Pss. 1:1-3; 19:7-11; 119:105; 2 Tim. 3:13-17).</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="through-relationships">Through Relationships</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>We encounter Jesus through the shared relationships. Jesus revealed Himself in the breaking of the bread, i.e., the meal he shared with these two disciples.</p></li>
<li><p>His true identity had been hidden/masked earlier, but now they see Him clearly (Luke 24:28-32).</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="through-relationships-1">Through Relationships</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Their statement, “Our hearts burned within us,” could be understood in several ways. Perhaps it was a subtle miraculous manifestation of Jesus’s power and position.</p></li>
<li><p>Perhaps it reflected Jesus’s talents as a teacher, who could make the text come alive (Matt. 7:28-29).</p></li>
<li><p>As we come to a better understanding of God’s word, we are enlightened, and emboldened: “Our hearts burn within us. . .” (Jer. 20:7-9).</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="shared-common-meals">Shared Common Meals</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Relationships are developed and deepened as we spend time together.</p></li>
<li><p>Shared meals are significant: social association is an expression of hospitality and harmony.</p></li>
<li><p>This is true of common means, such when Abraham extended hospitality to the three travelers at the oak of Mamre (Gen. 18:1-8, 16-21; cf. Heb. 13:1-2).</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="shared-memorial-meals">Shared Memorial Meals</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>This is also true of memorial meals, such as the observance of the Lord’s supper, which Paul called the “cup of blessing. . .” (1 Cor. 10:14-17).</p></li>
<li><p>We see Christ more clearly in the breaking of bread on the first day of the week (Acts 20:7).</p></li>
<li><p>The weekly observance of the Lord’s supper is an act of communion, i.e., shared fellowship in the family of God (1 Cor. 11:17-34).</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>The Emmaus road was one of reassessment.</p></li>
<li><p>The Emmaus road was one of revelation.</p></li>
<li><p>The Emmaus road was one of relationships.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="walking-the-road-of-reassessment">Walking the Road of Reassessment</h1>
<ul>
<li>Recognizing that commonly held concepts are often wrong, may we be willing to reassess our underlying assumptions, while keeping our hope fixed on Jesus Christ.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="walking-the-road-of-revelation">Walking the Road of Revelation</h1>
<ul>
<li>Truth is revealed through a proper understanding of the entirety of divine revelation: including how the law, prophets, and psalms anticipate the establishment of the New Covenant, and the coming of the Messiah.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="walking-the-road-of-relationships">Walking the Road of Relationships</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>We come to know Jesus by listening to the Master teacher. We come to know Jesus through the breaking of the bread, i.e., the bread of life, and also through regularly observing the Lord’s supper.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, like the men who walked with Jesus on the Emmaus road, may our hearts burn within us as we contemplate the word of Jesus Christ.</p></li>
</ul>
