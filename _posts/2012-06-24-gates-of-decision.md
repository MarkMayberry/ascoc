<h2 style="text-align: left;">Introduction</h2>
In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus said, “Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it. For the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life, and there are few who find it” (Matt. 7:13-14).
<h2>Deciding Between Good and Evil</h2>
In the Old Testament, Israel was expected to make righteous judgments (Deut. 17:1-7; 21:18-21). In the New Testament, Christians must do the same (John 7:24; 1 Cor. 5:1-13).
<h2>Deciding Between Wisdom and Folly</h2>
Wisdom cries out at the entrance of the gates of the city, calling men to sober and serious reflection (Prov. 1:20-33; 8:1-11, 32-36). Those who follow such a course enjoy lives that are productive and praiseworthy (Psa. 127:3-5; Prov. 31:23, 28-31).
<h2>Deciding Between Life and Death</h2>
The wicked dig a pit for themselves, sinking deep into its mire; yet, God graciously lifts us up from the gates of death (Psa. 9:11-20; 107:17-22). Moreover, heaven is pictured as a glorious city, New Jerusalem, with 12 pearly gates, three on the east and three on the north and three on the south and three on the west, providing perfect security, never needing to be closed (Rev. 21:10-13, 21-27; 22:14-15).
<h2>Confession or Condemnation</h2>
Wicked men ridiculed and mocked the Messiah, Jesus Christ (Psa. 69:1-12). Yet, God’s eternal plan and purpose was realized through the Suffering Savior’s death on the cross: “Upon this rock I will build My church; and the gates of Hades will not overpower it” (Matt. 16:13-19). As Jesus suffered outside the gate, let us go out to Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach (Heb. 13:7-14).
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
As creatures of choice, we face gates of decision on a daily basis (Psa. 24:1-10). Will we allow Christ entrance into our hearts and lives (Rev. 3:19-20)?
