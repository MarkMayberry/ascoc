<h3><b>By Mark Mayberry     <br />2/5/2012</b></h3>  <h4>Introduction</h4>  <p>Men hold differing concepts about heaven and hell. Materialists deny the reality of an afterlife. Mystics believe that heaven and hell are subjective creations of the individual. Some believe in reincarnation. Others claim that we create our own heaven or hell here on earth.</p>  <p>Sacred Scripture affirms that we are dual beings, composed of body and soul, flesh and spirit. Judgment follows death (Heb. 9:27-28). Afterwards, we will either be welcomed into the bliss of heaven, or cast into the lake of fire. Both realms are real (Acts 24:14-15); both are eternal (Matt. 25:46).</p>  <h4>What Are They Like?</h4>  <h5>Heaven</h5>  <p>· Heaven is a place of protection (Matt. 6:19-21; 1 Pet. 1:3-5).</p>  <p>· Heaven is a place of provision (John 14:1-3; 2 Cor. 5:1-5).</p>  <p>· Heaven is a place of permanence (Heb. 11:8-10, 13-16).</p>  <p>· Heaven is a place of reward (Luke 6:22-23; Rev. 11:16-18).</p>  <p>· Heaven is a place of rest (Heb. 4:9-11; Rev. 14:13).</p>  <p>· Heaven is a place of renewal (Rev. 21:1-5; 22:1-5).</p>  <p>· Heaven is a place of glory (Phil. 3:20-21; Rev. 21:10-21).</p>  <h5>Hell</h5>  <p>· Hell is a place of separation (Matt. 25:41; Rev. 22:14-15).</p>  <p>· Hell is a place of fire (Matt. 3:11-12; 13:41-42).</p>  <p>· Hell is a place of pain/anguish (Matt. 13:41-42; Luke 13:28-30).</p>  <p>· Hell is a place of death/decay (Mark 9:42-48; cf. Isa. 66:22-24).</p>  <p>· Hell is a place of darkness (Matt. 22:11-14; Jude 11-13).</p>  <h4>Who Will Enter Therein?</h4>  <h5>Heaven</h5>  <p>· Those who wash their robes (Rev. 7:13-17; 22:14; cf. Acts 22:16; Titus 3:3-7).</p>  <p>· Those who engage in good works (1 Tim. 6:17-19; cf. Eph. 2:4-10; 2 Thess. 2:13-17).</p>  <p>· Those who are responsible (Matt. 25:14-23; Luke 12:35-44; 1 Cor. 4:1-5).</p>  <p>· Those who are victorious (Rev. 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21, 21:7).</p>  <h5>Hell</h5>  <p>· Those who are undisciplined (Matt. 5:27-30; 18:8-9).</p>  <p>· Those who are lawless (Matt. 7:21-23; 13:41-42).</p>  <p>· Those who are neglectful (Matt. 25:29-30, 41-46).</p>  <p>· Those who are unprepared (Matt. 22:11-13; 25:1-13).</p>  <p>· Those who are immoral (1 Cor. 6:9-11; Rev. 21:7-8, 27; 22:15).</p>  <p>· Those who are disobedient (Rom. 2:4-11; 2 Thess. 1:6-10).</p>  <h4>Conclusion</h4>  <p>Heaven is a wonderful realm; in contrast, hell is dreadful beyond compare. Have you washed your robes in the blood of the Lamb? Are you using the time that you have been allotted in a responsible manner? Are you laying up for yourself treasures in heaven? Are you living in view of eternity?</p>
