## Introduction

In the Old Testament, God pleaded with Israel, saying, "Come now, and let us reason together. . ." (Isa. 1:18-20).

> "Come now, and let us reason together," Says the LORD, "Though your sins are as scarlet, They will be as white as snow; Though they are red like crimson, They will be like wool. If you consent and obey, You will eat the best of the land; "But if you refuse and rebel, You will be devoured by the sword. Truly, the mouth of the LORD has spoken" (Isa. 1:18-20).

Later, in arguing against the validity of idols, the Lord said, "Present your case. Bring forward your strong arguments. . ." (Isa. 41:21-29).

> "Present your case," the LORD says. "Bring forward your strong arguments," The King of Jacob says. "Let them bring forth and declare to us what is going to take place; As for the former events, declare what they were, That we may consider them and know their outcome. Or announce to us what is coming; Declare the things that are going to come afterward, That we may know that you are gods; Indeed, do good or evil, that we may anxiously look about us and fear together. Behold, you are of no account, And your work amounts to nothing; He who chooses you is an abomination. I have aroused one from the north, and he has come; From the rising of the sun he will call on My name; And he will come upon rulers as upon mortar, Even as the potter treads clay. Who has declared this from the beginning, that we might know? Or from former times, that we may say, He is right!? Surely there was no one who declared, Surely there was no one who proclaimed, Surely there was no one who heard your words. Formerly I said to Zion, 'Behold, here they are.' And to Jerusalem, 'I will give a messenger of good news.' But when I look, there is no one, And there is no counselor among them Who, if I ask, can give an answer. Behold, all of them are false; Their works are worthless, Their molten images are wind and emptiness" (Isa. 41:21-29).

In the New Testament, Paul's pattern for evangelism involved reasoning in the synagogue and market place, trying to persuade Jews and Greeks that Jesus was the Christ (Acts 17:16-17; 18:1-4, 18-19; 19:8-10).

> Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was being provoked within him as he was observing the city full of idols. So he was **reasoning** in the synagogue with the Jews and the God-fearing Gentiles, and in the market place every day with those who happened to be present (Acts 17:16-17).

> After these things he left Athens and went to Corinth. And he found a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, having recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to leave Rome. He came to them, and because he was of the same trade, he stayed with them and they were working, for by trade they were tent-makers. And he was **reasoning** in the synagogue every Sabbath and trying to persuade Jews and Greeks (Acts 18:1-4).

> Paul, having remained many days longer, took leave of the brethren and put out to sea for Syria, and with him were Priscilla and Aquila. In Cenchrea he had his hair cut, for he was keeping a vow. They came to Ephesus, and he left them there. Now he himself entered the synagogue and **reasoned** with the Jews (Acts 18:18-19).

> And he entered the synagogue and continued speaking out boldly for three months, **reasoning** and persuading them about the kingdom of God. But when some were becoming hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of the Way before the people, he withdrew from them and took away the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus. This took place for two years, so that all who lived in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks (Acts 19:8-10).

The Greek word *dialegomai,* translated "reasoning" in the aforementioned vereses, means "to discuss, to address, to preach" (Thomas, 1256).

Arndt defines it as (1) to engage in speech interchange, *converse, discuss, argue*; (2) to instruct about something, *inform, instruct*" (BDAG, 232).

While it can refer to an argument or dispute (Mark 9:34; Acts 24:12; Jude 9; etc.), it also means to "make a speech" or engage in a discussion "reasonable discourse" (Acts 17:2, 17; 18:4, 19; 19:8, 9; 20:7, 9; 24:25; Heb. 12:5; etc.) (Swanson, 1363).

The apostle Paul did not harangue his audience.  He did not rant or rave.  He did not employ invectives or insults.  Rather, he sought to convince and convert his hearers: Standing before King Agrippa, he said, "I would wish to God, that whether in a short or long time, not only you, but also all who hear me this day, might become such as I am, except for these chains" (Acts 26:24-29, esp. v. 29).  Writing to the Romans, Paul said, "I could wish that I myself were accursed, separated from Christ for the sake of my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh. . . my heart’s desire and my prayer to God for them is for their salvation" (Rom. 9:1-5; 10:1).

> "While Paul was saying this in his defense, Festus said in a loud voice, “Paul, you are out of your mind! Your great learning is driving you mad.” But Paul said, “I am not out of my mind, most excellent Festus, but I utter words of sober truth. “For the king knows about these matters, and I speak to him also with confidence, since I am persuaded that none of these things escape his notice; for this has not been done in a corner. “King Agrippa, do you believe the Prophets? I know that you do.” Agrippa replied to Paul, “In a short time you will persuade me to become a Christian.” And Paul said, “I would wish to God, that whether in a short or long time, not only you, but also all who hear me this day, might become such as I am, except for these chains” (Acts 26:24-29).

> I am telling the truth in Christ, I am not lying, my conscience testifies with me in the Holy Spirit, that I have great sorrow and unceasing grief in my heart. For I could wish that I myself were accursed, separated from Christ for the sake of my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh, who are Israelites, to whom belongs the adoption as sons, and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the Law and the temple service and the promises, whose are the fathers, and from whom is the Christ according to the flesh, who is over all, God blessed forever. Amen (Rom. 9:1-5).

> Brethren, my heart’s desire and my prayer to God for them is for their salvation (Rom. 10:1).


## The Duty of the Prophets

The Old Testament prophets were commanded to speak, and not be afraid or ashamed. Moreover, they were directly and divinely empowered (Jer. 26:1-6, 7-11, 12-16).

> In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came from the LORD, saying, "Thus says the LORD, Stand in the court of the LORD'S house, and speak to all the cities of Judah who have come to worship in the LORD'S house all the words that I have commanded you to speak to them. Do not omit a word! Perhaps they will listen and everyone will turn from his evil way, that I may repent of the calamity which I am planning to do to them because of the evil of their deeds." And you will say to them, "Thus says the LORD, If you will not listen to Me, to walk in My law which I have set before you, to listen to the words of My servants the prophets, whom I have been sending to you again and again, but you have not listened; then I will make this house like Shiloh, and this city I will make a curse to all the nations of the earth" (Jer. 26:1-6).

> The priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the LORD. When Jeremiah finished speaking all that the LORD had commanded him to speak to all the people, the priests and the prophets and all the people seized him, saying, "You must die! Why have you prophesied in the name of the LORD saying, 'This house will be like Shiloh and this city will be desolate, without inhabitant'? And all the people gathered about Jeremiah in the house of the LORD." When the officials of Judah heard these things, they came up from the king's house to the house of the LORD and sat in the entrance of the New Gate of the LORD'S house. Then the priests and the prophets spoke to the officials and to all the people, saying, "A death sentence for this man! For he has prophesied against this city as you have heard in your hearing" (Jer. 26:7-11).

> Then Jeremiah spoke to all the officials and to all the people, saying, "The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that you have heard. Now therefore amend your ways and your deeds and obey the voice of the LORD your God; and the LORD will change His mind about the misfortune which He has pronounced against you. But as for me, behold, I am in your hands; do with me as is good and right in your sight. Only know for certain that if you put me to death, you will bring innocent blood on yourselves, and on this city and on its inhabitants; for truly the LORD has sent me to you to speak all these words in your hearing." Then the officials and all the people said to the priests and to the prophets, "No death sentence for this man! For he has spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God" (Jer. 26:12-16).

## The Duty of the Apostles

The New Testament apostles were commanded to be ready to speak, and not be afraid or ashamed. Moreover, they were directly and divinely empowered (Matt. 10:16-20; Luke 21:12-15; cf. Acts 4:5-12).

> Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves; so be shrewd as serpents and innocent as doves. But beware of men, for they will hand you over to the courts and scourge you in their synagogues; and you will even be brought before governors and kings for My sake, as a testimony to them and to the Gentiles. But when they hand you over, do not worry about how or what you are to say; for it will be given you in that hour what you are to say. For it is not you who speak, but it is the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you (Matt. 10:16-20).

> But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you and will persecute you, delivering you to the synagogues and prisons, bringing you before kings and governors for My name's sake. It will lead to an opportunity for your testimony. So make up your minds not to prepare beforehand to defend yourselves; for I will give you utterance and wisdom which none of your opponents will be able to resist or refute (Luke 21:12-15).

> On the next day, their rulers and elders and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem; and Annas the high priest was there, and Caiaphas and John and Alexander, and all who were of high-priestly descent. When they had placed them in the center, they began to inquire, "By what power, or in what name, have you done this?" Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, "Rulers and elders of the people, if we are on trial today for a benefit done to a sick man, as to how this man has been made well, let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead—by this name this man stands here before you in good health. He is the STONE WHICH WAS REJECTED by you, THE BUILDERS, but WHICH BECAME THE CHIEF CORNER stone. And there is salvation in no one else; for there is no other name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must be saved" (Acts 4:5-12).

## The Duty of Disciples

Unlike the prophets and apostles, we do not enjoy the gift of inspired utterance (1 Cor. 13:8-13), we are nevertheless empowered through knowing and obeying the perfect law of liberty (Jas. 1:19-25).

> Love never fails; but if there are gifts of prophecy, they will be done away; if there are tongues, they will cease; if there is knowledge, it will be done away. For we know in part and we prophesy in part; but when the perfect comes, the partial will be done away. When I was a child, I used to speak like a child, think like a child, reason like a child; when I became a man, I did away with childish things. For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face; now I know in part, but then I will know fully just as I also have been fully known. But now faith, hope, love, abide these three; but the greatest of these is love (1 Cor. 13:8-13).

> This you know, my beloved brethren. But everyone must be quick to hear, slow to speak and slow to anger; for the anger of man does not achieve the righteousness of God. Therefore, putting aside all filthiness and all that remains of wickedness, in humility receive the word implanted, which is able to save your souls. But prove yourselves doers of the word, and not merely hearers who delude themselves. For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at his natural face in a mirror; for once he has looked at himself and gone away, he has immediately forgotten what kind of person he was. But one who looks intently at the perfect law, the law of liberty, and abides by it, not having become a forgetful hearer but an effectual doer, this man will be blessed in what he does (Jas. 1:19-25).

Absent the gift of personal guidance, how do we fulfill the divine command, "Let your speech always be with grace, as though seasoned with salt, so that you will know how you should respond to each person" (Col. 4:6)?

By serious study and personal preparation.  Paul commanded Timothy, "Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth" (2 Tim. 2:14-26, esp. v. 15). The Greek word *orthotomeō,* rendered "rightly dividing" (KJV), "rightly handling" (ESV), or "accurately handling" (NASB) literally means "to cut straight" (Thomas, 3718).  Arndt says it is "found elsewhere independently of the NT only in Proverbs 3:6; 11:5, where it is used with *hodos* (road) and plainly means ‘cut a path in a straight direction’ or ‘cut a road across country (that is forested or otherwise difficult to pass through) in a straight direction’, so that the traveler may go directly to his destination" (BDAG, 722).

> Remind them of these things, and solemnly charge them in the presence of God not to wrangle about words, which is useless and leads to the ruin of the hearers. **Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth.** But avoid worldly and empty chatter, for it will lead to further ungodliness, and their talk will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus, men who have gone astray from the truth saying that the resurrection has already taken place, and they upset the faith of some. Nevertheless, the firm foundation of God stands, having this seal, "The Lord knows those who are His," and, "Everyone who names the name of the Lord is to abstain from wickedness." Now in a large house there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also vessels of wood and of earthenware, and some to honor and some to dishonor. Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from these things, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, useful to the Master, prepared for every good work. Now flee from youthful lusts and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart. But refuse foolish and ignorant speculations, knowing that they produce quarrels. The Lord's bond-servant must not be quarrelsome, but be kind to all, able to teach, patient when wronged, with gentleness correcting those who are in opposition, if perhaps God may grant them repentance leading to the knowledge of the truth, and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil, having been held captive by him to do his will (2 Tim. 2:14-26).

> In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight (Prov. 3:6).

> The righteousness of the blameless will smooth his way, but the wicked will fall by his own wickedness (Prov. 11:5).

In a similar manner, Peter admonished believers to "sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts, always being ready to make a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you, yet with gentleness and reverence" (1 Pet. 3:13-16, esp. v. 15).

> Who is there to harm you if you prove zealous for what is good? But even if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness, you are blessed. AND DO NOT FEAR THEIR INTIMIDATION, AND DO NOT BE TROUBLED, but sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts, always being ready to make a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you, yet with gentleness and reverence; and keep a good conscience so that in the thing in which you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ will be put to shame. (1 Pet. 3:13-16).

The Greek word apologia, rendered "make a defense" (NASB) or "give an answer" (NIV84), refers to "a speech in defense" of someone or something (Thomas, 627).

Occurring eight times in the NT, it is used of Paul's defense of the gospel (Acts 22:1; 25:16; 1 Cor. 9:3; Phil. 1:7, 16; 2 Tim 4:16), and the Corinthians's vindication of themselves by repentance as required by the gospel (2 Cor. 7:11).

Arndt says it is frequently used as a legal term and refers to "(1) a speech of defense" or "(2) the act of making a defense, (a) in court, or (2) generally of eagerness to defend oneself (2 Cor. 7:11), or of defending the gospel (Phil. 1:7, 16) (BDAG, 117).

Brannan offers a detailed definition of "defense." In a legal sense, it refers to "the speech act of attempting to prove some act or belief to be reasonable, necessary, or right; especially occurring in a court of law (Acts 22:1; Phil. 1:7, 16; 1 Pet. 3:15). In a content sense, it refers to "a statement (either spoken or written) that is made to reply to an accusation; especially in a court of law (1 Cor. 9:3). It can also refer to a defense hearing," i.e., "formal attendance at a judicial proceeding for a defendant to respond to the charges against him (2 Tim. 4:16).

## Conclusion

To fulfil God's expectation, we need conviction, courage, clarity of mind, and a charitable disposition (John 8:31-32; 2 Tim. 2:15; 1 Pet. 3:15). If we will do our part (by studying, standing, and speaking), He will do His part (Isa. 55:10-11). If we stand with God, He will stand with us (Phil. 2:12-13).

> So Jesus was saying to those Jews who had believed Him, "If you continue in My word, then you are truly disciples of Mine; and you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free" (John 8:31-32).

> Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth (2 Tim. 2:15).

> but sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts, always being ready to make a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you, yet with gentleness and reverence (1 Pet. 3:15).

> For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven, And do not return there without watering the earth And making it bear and sprout, And furnishing seed to the sower and bread to the eater; So will My word be which goes forth from My mouth; It will not return to Me empty, Without accomplishing what I desire, And without succeeding in the matter for which I sent it (Isa. 55:10-11).

> So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling; for it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to work for His good pleasure (Phil. 2:12-13).
