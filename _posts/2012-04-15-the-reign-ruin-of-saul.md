<h3><b>By Mark Mayberry     <br />4/15/2012</b></h3>  <p>Let us consider the reign and ruin of Saul, who was divinely chosen to serve as Israel’s first King (1 Sam. 13:1; 14:49-51). He evidenced impatience in refusing to wait for the prophet Samuel (1 Sam. 13:2-15). He evidenced rashness in his foolish pronouncement on the battlefield (1 Sam. 14:24-30). He evidenced disobedience regarding God’s command to utterly destroy Amalek (1 Sam. 15:1-33). He evidenced insanity when, as punishment and consequence of his sins, he was troubled by an evil spirit from the Lord (1 Sam. 16:14-23). He evidenced cowardice when he, along with all Israel (save David), trembled before the blasphemous taunts of the Philistine (1 Sam. 17:1-11). He evidenced jealousy regarding the relatively greater praise ascribed to David (1 Sam. 18:6-11). He evidenced falseness in keeping his pledge and promise of reward (1 Sam. 17:24-27; 18:14-19). He evidenced cunning in his attempts to destroy a perceived rival (1 Sam. 18:20-30). He evidenced irresoluteness in his assurances to Jonathan (1 Sam. 19:1-10; 20:30-33). He evidenced faithlessness in resorting to cultic necromancy (1 Sam. 28:1-25). King Saul’s sad epitaph is a tragic summary of a wasted life (1 Chron. 10:13-14).</p>
