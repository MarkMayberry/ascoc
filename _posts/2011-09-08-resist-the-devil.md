<p>Paul said, “But if I am doing the very thing I do not want, I am no longer the one doing it, but sin which dwells in me” (Rom. 7:20; cf. also vs. 17). This is no excuse to sin. While believers occasionally succumb to temptation (1 John 1:8), Jesus revealed the path to victory: “It is written…” (Matt. 4:4, 6, 7, 10). Putting on the full armor of God, let us stand firm against the schemes of the devil (Eph. 6:11), recognizing his devious methods (2 Cor. 2:11), resisting him with firmness of faith (James 4:7; 1 Pet. 5:8–9), not giving him an opportunity (Eph. 4:27). </p>
